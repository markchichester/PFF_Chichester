    const explanations = {"-1": `The standard grade for a dropped pass.`, "-0.5": `This is the standard grade for a poor play that doesn’t involve a dropped pass. It’s used when a receiver fails to finish his route, stops early or is clearly responsible for a route miscommunication. It’s also commonly applied when a receiver drops a difficult (but still catchable) pass.`, "0": `Most catches short of the sticks or end zone, with no meaningful gain after the catch, fall into the zero grade bucket. This is also the default grade for incompletions when the receiver is not at fault.`, "0.5": `This first level of positive grading for receivers is typically awarded for plays that result in a first down or significantly improve the down and distance due to the receiver’s actions. For example, a receiver who runs a sharp route to the sticks, makes the catch and is immediately tackled. Or, one who catches a bubble screen and uses burst to beat a defender to the marker would earn this grade.`, "1.0": `This level of positive grade is typically awarded when a receiver gains significant yardage or makes multiple defenders miss to create a much bigger play. For example, a receiver who stacks a corner and hauls in a 30-yard deep ball, or one who takes a bubble screen, beats a defender to the marker and then adds additional yardage by making that defender miss. There are many ways for a receiver to finish a play at a +1 level.`, "1.5": `The final two levels of receiver grading involve stacking events, much like with halfback grading. For instance, a receiver who stacks a corner on a deep route might initially earn a +1, but if he makes that defender miss after the catch and finishes the play in the end zone, it bumps to a +1.5. Some plays also earn a +1.5 purely due to difficulty or skill — such as spectacular diving or one-handed catches through tight coverage. These are the wow plays that defy easy categorization.`};
