<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chase led all wide receivers in fantasy points and fantasy points per game last season. He’s consistently graded as a top-10 wide receiver, with his fantasy performance elevated by his environment. The <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/cincinnati-bengals/7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bengals</a> made no changes to the coaching staff impacting Chase, the quarterback room, the wide receiver room or the tight end room. This puts Chase in one of the most pass-friendly environments in the NFL, catching passes from the best passer. While we should expect regression from anyone who finishes first in fantasy points, the lack of changes in <a href="https://premium.pff.com/ncaa/teams/2024/REGPO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cincinnati</a> should help minimize the regression.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-bijan-robinson-player-profile">Bijan Robinson</a> was a rare top-10 NFL draft pick at running back, leading to hefty expectations. He began meeting those expectations over the second half of 2024, consistently playing over 70% of the Falcons' offensive snaps and running at least 17 times in all but one game. This led to 22.4 fantasy points per game over the last nine weeks. He didn’t see as many 15-plus-yard carries as other great running backs, even though he’s got the talent and speed to have those runs. It’s possible some positive regression could greatly help his fantasy production this season. He lost <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/drew-dalman/52270">Drew Dalman</a> at center and still has an elite backup in <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-tyler-allgeier-player-profile">Tyler Allgeier</a>, so there is also some room to lose fantasy value.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gibbs was the 12th overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft and is one of just three running backs selected with a top-20 pick in the last seven drafts. His playing time has been limited the past two seasons as he splits time with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-david-montgomery-player-profile">David Montgomery</a>. He’s managed to be an elite fantasy option with the most fantasy points per carry over the last two seasons of any running back. When Montgomery was injured late last season, he showed he could be the best running back in fantasy football if given enough opportunity. The Lions have a new offensive coordinator and new running back coach, which could lead to an increase in chances for Gibbs, pushing him closer to the top of the fantasy draft board.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jefferson has been the best wide receiver in the NFL since he was drafted in 2020, with a league-leading 93.6 receiving grade. He also ranks first in receiving yards per game at 96.5 and yards per route run at 2.64. He’s among the top five fantasy wide receivers in the last four seasons. No other wide receiver has accomplished that more than twice in those four years. In the previous three seasons, his fantasy points per game have been three points higher with <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kirk-cousins/7102">Kirk Cousins</a> compared to without him. That’s the difference between a top-five finish and a top-10 finish.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-brian-thomas-jr-player-profile">Brian Thomas Jr.</a> had a strong start to his rookie season and ended it among the league’s best fantasy receivers.

He played at least 84% of his team’s offensive snaps in all but one of those games. The team added <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-travis-hunter-player-profile">Travis Hunter</a> in the draft, and he will see a decent target rate, but typically, two great wide receivers can co-exist as long as there isn’t much more competition for targets. Thomas led all wide receivers in yards per route run out of the slot with 3.12, and new offensive coordinator Liam Coen has found a lot of success with his slot receivers in the past. An increased role in the slot could lead Thomas to remain among the top wide receivers in fantasy football.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nacua averaged 0.216 receptions per route and 0.3 targets per route over the last two seasons, which both rank the best among wide receivers. His target rate of 37.1% last season was the highest among all wide receivers with at least 75 routes run in the last 19 years. His 3.56 yards per route run ranks third best, behind <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/steve-smith/837">Steve Smith</a> in 2008 and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-tyreek-hill-player-profile">Tyreek Hill</a> in 2023. It’s been difficult for both Nacua and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-cooper-kupp-player-profile">Cooper Kupp</a> to have fantasy value in the same game over the past two seasons, with one wide receiver often shining, while the other struggles to hit 50 yards.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Collins was a third-round pick who broke out in 2023. He’s posted back-to-back seasons with PFF receiving grades in the 90s. Last season, he averaged 19 fantasy points per game when removing the games he was either injured, returning from injury, or Week 18 when the Texans had already secured their playoff spot. This would have been good for third-best among wide receivers. If anything, he will have less competition for targets this season without <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tank-dell/78874">Tank Dell</a> or <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-stefon-diggs-player-profile">Stefon Diggs</a>.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lamb was a first-round pick in 2020. For four years, he improved his quality of play, leading to a higher target rate each season. In 2023, he was the best wide receiver in fantasy football. Injuries to both himself and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-dak-prescott-player-profile">Dak Prescott</a> derailed his 2024 season. However, Prescott also wasn’t playing as well before his injury, leading to a noteworthy decrease in fantasy production compared to 2023, when everyone was healthy. Prescott will need to return to his 2023 form for Lamb to be a top-three fantasy wide receiver again. Given his play last season, age, and injury history, Lamb may only be a top-10 receiver rather than a top-three.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>St. Brown has been an incredibly consistent wide receiver over the last three seasons. His PFF receiving grade has ranged from 90.0-91.0. His playing time increased from 2021 to 2022 to 2023, leading him to peak in 2023 as the third-best wide receiver in total fantasy points and fourth-most in fantasy points per game. He ran fewer routes and had a lower target rate but scored more touchdowns in 2024, leading to a decrease in two fantasy points per game. He still finished among the top five receivers in fantasy points. While there is at least a chance some of the younger options in Detroit gain targets at the expense of St. Brown, he is still a relatively safe first-round option in fantasy drafts.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barkley was the second pick in the 2018 draft, finished as the overall RB1 as a rookie and then faced five mixed seasons with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants/21">New York Giants</a> before joining the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/philadelphia-eagles/24">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. He led the league in carries in Philadelphia despite not playing in Week 17. While he didn’t score touchdowns from the one-yard line thanks to the tush push, he more than made up for it with a ridiculous number of long touchdown runs. His long touchdown rate is bound to regress, which will make it harder for him to repeat as the RB1.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jeanty finished his time at Boise State with a 99.9 career rushing grade while averaging over 200 yards per game in his rookie season. He is one of the top three running back prospects of the past decade. He landed with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/las-vegas-raiders/23">Las Vegas Raiders</a> with the 6th overall pick in the draft, on the team that most needed a running back. Jeanty will be one of the few running backs in the NFL in a feature role. He proved in 2023 that he could be an elite receiving back with 3.2 yards per route run. The Raiders have limited receiving options, and Chip Kelly’s offenses have often featured running backs in the passing game. The only thing holding him back from the top few fantasy running backs is the offensive line. The top three projected running backs all play behind top-five run-blocking lines, while the Raiders' line is merely average.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nabers was a top-10 wide receiver in fantasy last season, and we should expect more of the same. The Giants' top four wide receivers and top three tight ends are identical to last season, so he didn’t gain any extra competition for targets. He had a relatively high floor and low ceiling when compared to other elite receivers last season. He gained at least eight PPR points in every game but only had three games over 85 receiving yards. That should change this season due to fewer targets thanks to <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/russell-wilson/7077">Russell Wilson</a>’s tendency to check down and more big plays thanks to Wilson’s high deep target rate.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-christian-mccaffrey-player-profile">Christian McCaffrey</a> has been the most dominant fantasy running back of the past decade, given his success in both the pass game and the run. However, he’s missed over 50% of the season during three of the last five years due to a wide variety of injuries. It’s hard to know exactly how predictive those injuries are of future injury, but there is also a risk of the 49ers limiting his snaps, or his play simply declining from all of the injuries and age. This makes McCaffrey one of the riskiest early draft picks.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>14. TE </strong><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-brock-bowers-player-profile"><strong>Brock Bowers</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/las-vegas-raiders/23"><strong>Las Vegas Raiders</strong></a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bowers joined the Raiders and immediately became the league’s top fantasy tight end. He led all tight ends in receptions and receiving yards as a rookie, resulting in the most fantasy points. Both <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-trey-mcbride-player-profile">Trey McBride</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-george-kittle-player-profile">George Kittle</a> missed games, and both finished slightly ahead of him in fantasy points per game. His 88.4 receiving grade also finished third among tight ends, behind Kittle and McBride. Bowers is expected to leap over the two tight ends with general improvements to the Raiders' offense, leading to more accurate passes thrown his way and more touchdowns. However, the coaching staff has a history of tight end committees, and the Raiders have better run-blocking tight ends on the roster, which could lead to Bowers getting used on fewer snaps this season than last.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>McBride became the Cardinals' primary tight end in the middle of the 2023 season, and he’s been an elite fantasy option at the position ever since. He averaged at least 15 PPR points in both seasons once he became the starter. McBride led the league in both receptions per game (6.9) and receptions per route (0.21) last season. His yards per game (71.6) and targets per game (8.7) were both second-best. The Cardinals kept the coaching staff and players on the offense essentially the same as last season, making it easier to expect more of the same from McBride. If anything, we can expect a few more touchdowns after his low touchdown total from last season.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Irving was a fourth-round pick by the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/tampa-bay-buccaneers/30">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> and, in his first year, finished fourth among running backs in PFF offensive grade, finishing with an elite grade as both a rusher and receiver. He started the season playing just over 30% of the Buccaneers' offensive snaps and ended playing around 70% of their snaps. He was among the top running backs at the end of the season. Most of his situation is the same this season, except for a change in offensive coordinator. There is a chance the backfield could go back towards a committee approach, but there is also a chance Irving becomes even more of an every-down back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-drake-london-player-profile">Drake London</a> was the eighth overall pick in the 2022 draft, but failed to be a regular fantasy football starter in his first two years due to limited quarterback play, Arthur Smith’s run-first offense, and a rotation at wide receiver.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown has been among the top wide receivers in the NFL, and his PFF receiving grade has improved in each of the last few seasons.

His routes per game dropped by six, and there were multiple games, including the playoffs, where the Eagles simply didn’t need to prioritize Brown. While he’s still capable of putting together several top-10 fantasy finishes, he’s also going to have a high rate of games outside the top-36 fantasy receivers, compared to other wide receivers of his talent.</p>

He played much better when <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-tua-tagovailoa-player-profile">Tua Tagovailoa</a> was healthy, as his target rate was much higher and the offense was generally playing better.

The threat of <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-lamar-jackson-player-profile">Lamar Jackson</a> also being able to run out of the backfield was a matchup nightmare for defenses, allowing both Jackson and Henry to thrive.

After a relatively slow start, McConkey shone over the last two months of the season, culminating with a nine-catch, 197-yard and one-touchdown performance in the playoffs. He averaged 20.7 PPR points per game over his last eight games, including the playoffs. However, offensive coordinator Greg Roman, a run-first coach, added two new running backs to lead the offense. They also revitalized the wide receiver and tight end room. This will cut into McConkey’s routes run, and could slightly cut into his target share.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allen has been the most consistent player from a fantasy football perspective. He’s ranked among the top three quarterbacks in fantasy points per game in the last five seasons. He might not be the best passer or rusher, but he’s a better rusher than the other top passers and a better passer than the other top rushers. The Bills used to be among the most pass-heavy teams in the league, but under Joe Brady, they’ve been more balanced. Combine that with the Bills' positive game scripts, which has led to a notable decrease in dropbacks per game. That has moved Allen from 24-25 fantasy points per game to 22-23. This should remain the case this season, unless he starts to run the ball less often, which is typical of quarterbacks as they age.</p>

However, the 49ers' run-first philosophy mixed with Kittle’s injury history has left Kittle running fewer routes than other elite tight ends.

His 0.42 avoided tackles per attempt last season were the most in PFF’s 19 years of statistics for all running backs with at least 50 carries. The next-most with any player with at least 150 carries in a season was 0.31, which is a tie that includes 2014 <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/marshawn-lynch/3628">Marshawn Lynch</a> and 2020 <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-nick-chubb-player-profile">Nick Chubb</a>. New offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will have an offense that plays to Walker’s strengths with his zone scheme and will prioritize getting him the football more than last season. However, he’s missed 10 games over the previous three seasons due to injury, and his play was negatively affected in several more while playing through injury. If he can stay healthy, he will have his best fantasy season yet, but staying healthy is a big if.</p>

<p>Rice slowly but surely worked his way to the top of the Chiefs' depth chart as a rookie and was a worthy fantasy starter more often than not after the first month of the season. He was on pace to be a league-winner before, finishing with the second-most fantasy points for a wide receiver in the first three weeks of the season. A torn LCL cost him the rest of the 2024 season. He appears on pace to play at the start of the league year, but he might take a little bit before he can play at his usual level.

<p>Williams was among the league leaders in carries each of the last two seasons, finishing with 19-20 carries per game that made him one of the most dependable fantasy running backs. His efficiency declined in 2024, producing 4.3 fewer fantasy points per game. Sean McVay has a unique history of sticking with a clear lead runner, regardless of who that lead runner is. That worked to William’s advantage last season because it meant <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-blake-corum-player-profile">Blake Corum</a> barely played on offense.

For many reasons, his fantasy points per start hit a new low last season. A lot of his stats that were down last season should bounce back this season, except for passing dropbacks per game. While that might increase from last season, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-saquon-barkley-player-profile">Saquon Barkley</a>’s presence will ensure he remains below league average in dropbacks per game.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taylor has mixed high volume with inefficient play. His rate of receiving a +-0.5 rushing grade is among the lowest in the league, while his rate of a +1 or higher is among the best in the league. Usually, this is the recipe for a big decline in fantasy production. However, Taylor has a high rate of big plays, the trust of the coaching staff, and an excellent 2021 season, so there is always a chance he returns to that form. He also has an extensive injury history, including an ankle injury in the middle of four of his last five seasons. Taylor is a fine top-15 fantasy option, with a decent chance to finish in the top 10, and an outside chance to return to the league’s elite.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown emerged as the Bengals’ starting running back early in the 2024 season, and once <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/zack-moss/40341">Zack Moss</a> landed on injured reserve, Brown was a top-three fantasy running back.

Brown followed <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-joe-mixon-player-profile">Joe Mixon</a> as the clear early down running back who rarely played on passing downs. He was in a pass-first offense but was able to score and receive plenty of opportunities because the offense was doing well. There should be a little regression in the offense this season, but the bigger concern is if Moss or sixth-round rookie <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tahj-brooks/123133">Tahj Brooks</a> can simply outplay Brooks, leading to a change in the starting lineup.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Hampton should be viewed as one of the top rookie running backs from the last few seasons and a lead running back on a run-heavy team.

However, the presence of <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-najee-harris-player-profile">Najee Harris</a> and the lack of receiving potential will likely prevent Hampton from being an immediate top-10 fantasy running back.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-james-cook-player-profile">James Cook</a> has been a worthy starter for the Bills' offense, benefiting from a strong supporting cast in Buffalo, but is limited due to the Bills' committee approach at running back. He only scored two rushing touchdowns in 2023, which hurt his fantasy production, and then scored 16 in 2024. This season will very likely be somewhere in between, making him a fine RB2 option, or even RB1 for someone waiting for a running back. The only concern is that Cook is in a contract year and wants a new contract after so many of his teammates secured long-term deals this offseason. While that could lead Cook to play even better than what we’ve seen, we could also see a holdout, or the Bills wanting a better look from <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-ray-davis-player-profile">Ray Davis</a> before next offseason.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>McLaurin has been a consistent fantasy option throughout his career. He’s always finished among the top-31 wide receivers in fantasy points while staying healthy, not missing a game in the last four seasons.

His contested catch rate was the best for any wide receiver in the last six seasons at 70.6%, which led to nine of his 13 touchdowns.

The most concerning thing is that new head coach <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kellen-moore/7466">Kellen Moore</a> has a history of not prioritizing running backs in the game, even when he’s had <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-saquon-barkley-player-profile">Saquon Barkley</a>, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-austin-ekeler-player-profile">Austin Ekeler</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ezekiel-elliott/10638">Ezekiel Elliott</a> during his peak.

<p>Harrison’s first season was full of big expectations, which he didn’t fully live up to. He was the fourth overall pick in the draft, making him the earliest a wide receiver was selected in a decade, but he only exceeded 65 receiving yards in three games. Luckily, his target rate was high, and his target competition remains limited. He received the 19th-most targets, and the top of the Cardinals' running back, wide receiver and tight end depth chart are identical to last season. He should finish among the top-20 wide receivers in targets again, and he needs to improve his chemistry with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-kyler-murray-player-profile">Kyler Murray</a> so his fantasy value can also be among the top-20 wide receivers.

He has consistently finished between WR16-WR25, outside of a top-10 finish with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-justin-fields-player-profile">Justin Fields</a> at quarterback.

<p>Smith-Njigba, a 2023 first-round pick, didn’t add much fantasy value over his first season and a half. He turned to fantasy gold in November of 2024, racking up the second-most fantasy points over eight weeks, before a quiet end of the season. The Seahawks changed offensive coordinators this offseason, bringing in Klint Kubiak, and moved on from wide receivers <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-d-k-metcalf-player-profile">D.K. Metcalf</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tyler-lockett/9502">Tyler Lockett</a>. Kubiak’s offenses typically don't feature a slot receiver heavily but do focus on the run game and deep passes. Unless Kubiak can adjust his offense to Smith-Njigba’s strengths, or Smith-Njigba can thrive in a different role, the third-year receiver could have a quieter season.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hill, at his best, is an elite option in fantasy football, but we didn’t see Hill at his best last season. His fantasy points per game dropped from 23.5 in 2023 to 12.8 in 2024. It’s possible that a wrist injury and injuries to <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-tua-tagovailoa-player-profile">Tua Tagovailoa</a> derailed his season and are a thing of the past. However, a lower separation rate, lower deep target rate and higher contested target rate suggest the 31-year-old receiver isn't the same player he once was.

<p>The sky is the limit for Hunter, a truly unique athlete. He is arguably the best wide receiver and best cornerback in the 2025 draft class. That uniqueness makes it difficult to project how much he can help a fantasy manager at the wide receiver position. Fantasy-relevant wide receivers are consistently playing a minimum of 75% of offensive snaps, and there is a chance Hunter falls below that threshold. His role on offense could be restricted in a way that makes Hunter unstartable, but Hunter could also become the top wide receiver in the NFL and fantasy. He is arguably the most risky player to pick in fantasy drafts, offering both significant risk and reward.</p>

He’s consistently ranked among the low-end RB1 or high-end RB2 in recent seasons when looking at points per game, but he’s often missed a few games each season, making his overall rank a little lower. The <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-trey-benson-player-profile">Trey Benson</a> addition in the 2024 draft makes it difficult to fully trust Conner, but he’s also put together his best two seasons of his career in terms of his quality of play. Over the last two seasons, he ranks second among running backs in rushing avoided tackles per game (4.5), rushing avoided tackles per attempt (0.297) and yards after contact per attempt (3.6).

This helped him to the most completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns on the season.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-devonta-smith-player-profile">DeVonta Smith</a> has been a consistent top-24 fantasy wide receiver throughout his career. He played more often in the slot last season, earning 2.23 yards per route run over the last three seasons. This led to a higher target rate, a career-high yards per route run and receiving grade and fantasy points per game, despite the team running the ball much more frequently. The team lost offensive coordinator <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kellen-moore/7466">Kellen Moore</a>, who helped elevate Smith’s play by putting him in situations to succeed. Injuries to <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-a-j-brown-player-profile">A.J.

The fact that Mixon ranks second in career rushing attempts for active players could lead to the Texans resting him more. The increase in passing options could lead to fewer rushing attempts as well. This will likely make him fall outside of the top 10 fantasy running backs. He should be viewed as a low-end RB2, with the upside of remaining a low-end RB1, but also the risk of getting benched in favor of Chubb.</p>

A lot of little things are working against him, like a potentially fully healthy <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-t-j-hockenson-player-profile">T.J.

<p>Samuel has been a solid fantasy starter when healthy, peaking as the third overall wide receiver in 2021. However, Samuel has dealt with several injuries throughout his career. In 2024 alone, he was listed with six different injuries on the official NFL injury reports. He was traded to the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/washington-commanders/32">Washington Commanders</a> this offseason, pairing him with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. When Kingsbury was with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/arizona-cardinals/1">Arizona Cardinals</a>, he found unique ways to use <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/rondale-moore/62890">Rondale Moore</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/greg-dortch/42237">Greg Dortch</a> on short passes and passes out of the backfield. They should be able to use Samuel in the same way, but with more success. Samuel should be able to find more success than he had last season, unless injuries hinder his ability and playing time again.</p>

<p>Hockenson was a top-six fantasy tight end in points per game from 2020 to 2023, including a tie for the top overall spot in 2023. He tore his ACL and MCL at the end of 2023. He returned faster than the average player with a similar injury, and understandably didn’t play as much and wasn’t as effective. He will be much further removed from his injury for the 2025 season, but some players never return to the player they were before that injury. Luckily, even if he doesn’t have the same speed, he’s still strong on contested catches, but that won’t command the same target share as he’s had in the past.</p>

His role could be impacted by <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-jalen-mcmillan-player-profile">Jalen McMillan</a> and 19th-overall pick <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-emeka-egbukas-player-profile">Emeka Egbuka</a>, who also specialize in slot positions, potentially reducing Godwin's playing time as he recovers.

He’s been able to propel himself to a low-end WR2 these last two seasons, despite his situation not always being perfect. The Raiders made several changes to their offense this offseason. The biggest positive for Meyers is the <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-qb-geno-smith-player-profile">Geno Smith</a> addition, giving Meyers a better quarterback than he’s seen throughout his time as a starter in the NFL. This should lead to a higher touchdown total than last season. However, the team added <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-ashton-jeanty-player-profile">Ashton Jeanty</a>, which almost certainly will lead the Raiders to run more than last season, leading to Meyers running fewer routes.

His fantasy production wasn’t as consistent in 2024. Part of this was likely due to multiple injuries early in the season. However, this was also likely due to other players stepping up in the passing game, including <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-jameson-williams-player-profile">Jameson Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-david-montgomery-player-profile">David Montgomery</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-jordan-mason-player-profile">Jordan Mason</a> quickly went from undrafted rookie to the top backup running back for the 49ers, despite the team consistently spending mid-to-late round draft picks on running backs. An injury to <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-christian-mccaffrey-player-profile">Christian McCaffrey</a> allowed Mason to be a starter to begin the 2024 season, and he was sixth in fantasy points per game over five weeks before he started dealing with injuries.

The <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/green-bay-packers/12">Green Bay Packers</a> allow him an opportunity to become an actual number one receiver, a chance he wasn’t going to see with most teams.

The general appeal of a Chiefs running back is that they are typically a high-scoring offense, so even though they pass the ball a lot, their running back should score a lot of touchdowns. The offense hasn’t scored as many points in the last two seasons, but that could change this year with a healthy wide receiver room. There’s a chance he gets back to his 2023 form, scoring potentially more touchdowns, but there is also a chance he is in an ugly three-man backfield that changes from one week to the next, making it impossible to know if or when you can start him.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-jonnu-smith-player-profile">Jonnu Smith</a> is the rare eighth-year breakout player after stints with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/tennessee-titans/31">Tennessee Titans</a>, <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-england-patriots/19">New England Patriots</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/atlanta-falcons/2">Atlanta Falcons</a>. Throughout his season with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/miami-dolphins/17">Miami Dolphins</a>, his playing time increased, leading to more targets and more fantasy points. Over the last two months of the season, he averaged nearly a touchdown per game. His career year coincided with both <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-tyreek-hill-player-profile">Tyreek Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-jaylen-waddle-player-profile">Jaylen Waddle</a> underperforming compared to their expectations. One or both wide receivers may rebound. Smith’s fantasy value should be able to handle one receiver bouncing back, but it would be difficult if both do.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Odunze was the ninth overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft but didn’t perform from a fantasy perspective like other recent top-10 wide receivers in their rookie season. He showed sparks in a few games but more often than not failed to finish among the top-48 fantasy wide receivers of the week. The <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/chicago-bears/6">Chicago Bears</a> gave him more competition for targets with tight end <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-cameron-ward-player-profile">Colston Loveland</a> in the first round and wide receiver <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-luther-burden-iiis-player-profile">Luther Burden III</a> in the second. In most cases, a new regime bringing in two new receivers would be devastating to an incumbent receiver who wasn’t fantasy-relevant. However, the Bears' new head coach is <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ben-johnson/47039">Ben Johnson</a>, who led an offense where nearly all of the skill players who played significant snaps were fantasy starters. Odunze could emerge as the top receiver in the offense, but he could also fall to the fourth option on passing plays.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-brandon-aiyuk-player-profile">Brandon Aiyuk</a> was a first-round pick by the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/san-francisco-49ers/28">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 2010, and he slowly but surely improved each season until he reached an elite PFF receiving grade in 2023. He had back-to-back top-15 fantasy seasons, but his success led to a holdout in 2024 that didn’t get resolved until briefly before the season. This led to seven mostly underwhelming weeks in 2024 before Aiyuk’s season abruptly ended with an ACL and MCL tear. The injury could leave Aiyuk missing time to start the 2025 season, and it often takes time before a wide receiver is back to his usual quality of play. Ideally, Aiyuk can be back to normal to help fantasy managers with their playoff pushes mid-season, but there is also a chance Aiyuk will not be back to normal at any point this season.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-calvin-ridley-player-profile">Calvin Ridley</a> became a star with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/atlanta-falcons/2">Atlanta Falcons</a> but missed nearly two seasons for non-injury reasons. He’s been the clear top wide receiver on below-average offenses the last two seasons. His stats over the last two seasons were remarkably similar despite playing for two different teams. The one exception was a clear drop in touchdowns last season. The Titans drafted <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-cameron-ward-player-profile">Cameron Ward</a> with the first overall pick, giving Ridley one major reason for optimism. If Ward struggles in his first season, which is common for first overall picks heading to the team with the worst record, then we should expect more of the same out of Ridley. However, if Ward shines in his rookie season, that should give Ridley a significant boost in fantasy production.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-rhamondre-stevenson-player-profile">Rhamondre Stevenson</a> has spent the last four seasons with the Patriots and has been an every-down lead back with a capable veteran backup most of the time. His quality of play is very dependent on the offensive line, and the line had the worst team run-blocking grade last season. He reunites with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was his offensive coordinator in his first season. In 17 of McDaniels' 18 seasons, the running back who leads his team in rushing attempts is not the same one who leads his backfield in third-down snaps. The Patriots spent the 38th overall pick on <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-rj-harveys-player-profile">TreVeyon Henderson</a>, who was arguably the best receiving back in this draft class. That means Stevenson will likely lose most of his passing-down work. He should still receive double-digit carries most weeks, and the Patriots made multiple changes to the offensive line, which should help his production.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henderson was typically a rotational running back throughout his time at Ohio State, where his volume wasn’t as great as that of other running backs, but his rate stats were robust. He joins a <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-england-patriots/19">New England Patriots</a> team with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-rhamondre-stevenson-player-profile">Rhamondre Stevenson</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/antonio-gibson/78050">Antonio Gibson</a>, where they could form a three-back committee. His biggest obstacle could be offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who has consistently utilized the committee approach at running back. Henderson is more likely to take the third-down role in McDaniels’ offense rather than the early-down role, which wouldn’t be great for his fantasy value.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Johnson was very impressive as a runner in his one season as a starter, averaging over 125 rushing yards per game. His rate of hitting big runs was among the best in the league. He ranks among the top 25 fastest running backs in the FBS from the last eight seasons, according to PFF’s tracking data, despite a below-average 4.57-second 40-yard dash at the combine. He joined the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/pittsburgh-steelers/25">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, where <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-jaylen-warren-player-profile">Jaylen Warren</a> will take all of the receiving work, and Warren and Johnson will compete for the rushing snaps. Chances are that the two will see a split of around 50-50. The good news for Johnson is that offensive coordinator Arthur Smith is the most run-heavy coordinator in the league. Smith’s run rate over expected the last three seasons has been 13.0%, 7.9% and 6.2%.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-david-njoku-player-profile">David Njoku</a> has been a top-eight fantasy tight end for the past three seasons thanks to his limited competition for targets and a coaching staff that trusts him, even though his receiving grades haven’t been the highest. The Browns didn’t make many significant changes to their receiving room, so Njoku’s floor should remain high this season as long as he doesn’t have a significant dropoff in play. However, the Browns invested in two running backs in the draft, which will likely lead them to run the ball more often this season than last. The unsettled quarterback situation, wide receiver room and offensive line could lead the offense to be low scoring, which all limit Njoku’s upside. He has one of the highest floors for all tight ends, but he is unlikely to finish among the top-five fantasy tight ends again this season.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-brock-purdy-player-profile">Brock Purdy</a> went from the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft to the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/san-francisco-49ers/28">San Francisco 49ers</a>' starter. In 2023, he was a top-10 fantasy quarterback, but Kyle Shanahan's scheme and all of the 49ers' skill players got a lot of the credit. In 2024, the 49ers were losing, Purdy dealt with injuries, and all of the 49ers' best offensive players missed significant time. Purdy’s fantasy points per game only dropped by 0.4. Purdy ran more often to help make up for the decreased passing value, which ultimately made him more consistent from a fantasy perspective. Purdy doesn’t have the elite rushing or passing value to make him a top-five fantasy quarterback, but he’s a relatively safe bet to finish as a top-10 quarterback again.</p>

He joins the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-york-jets/22">New York Jets</a>, where his salary is large enough that he’s unlikely to get benched this season. He has an offensive coordinator who hasn’t typically run with his quarterback very often, but that will change this season.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-tucker-kraft-player-profile">Tucker Kraft</a> was the Packers' clear top tight end in 2024. He was excellent with the ball in his hands, leading the league in yards after the catch per catch and avoided tackle rate. However, his target rate was among the lowest for a starting tight end. This resulted in Kraft not averaging enough points to be a consistent fantasy starter, but he also wasn’t too far behind the top 12. The Packers' coaches have made it a point to talk about wanting to get him the ball more often. If they follow through, it will make Kraft a top-12 option at the position.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<p>Skattebo was the slowest among the top 11 projected rookie running backs, averaging a max speed of 0.7 miles per hour less than the next closest running back. However, his large size relative to his height makes him great at converting first downs. His 33.6% first downs per attempt was the highest among the same top 11 backs in the class. He landed with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants/21">New York Giants</a>, where there is a chance he could win both the early-down and receiving back roles, despite being drafted in the fourth round.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-stefon-diggs-player-profile">Stefon Diggs</a> has a decade of experience in the NFL, and most of that time has been spent as a top-20 fantasy wide receiver. He is the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-england-patriots/19">New England Patriots</a>' new top receiver, although he missed half of last season after suffering an ACL tear, which could cost him the start of the 2025 campaign. Even when Diggs is ready to play again, he might not be the same player. He will turn 32 years old before the end of the season, an age at which wide receivers tend to decline, even ignoring the injury. Diggs should be able to gain some chemistry with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-drake-maye-player-profile">Drake Maye</a>, who has been very accurate on shorter passes, which pairs well with Diggs' low average depth of target in recent seasons.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tracy was a fifth-round rookie in 2024. It only took Tracy a little over a month to crack the Giants' starting lineup, and for the middle part of the season, he was a top-10 fantasy running back. He slowed down over the final third of the season to the disappointment of fantasy managers who picked him up off waivers. The Giants selected <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-cameron-skattebo-player-profile">Cameron Skattebo</a> in the fourth round of the NFL draft this year, which will give Tracy some serious competition for playing time. Tracy won’t have any fantasy value if he loses the starting job, and a 50/50 split could lead to both running backs being unstartable. If Tracy can maintain his playing time, there is a chance he could have more value this season thanks to <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/russell-wilson/7077">Russell Wilson</a> being the likely starter at quarterback, and his recent history of checking down to his running back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-rb-j-k-dobbins-player-profile">J.K. Dobbins</a> has seen a rollercoaster of a career, battling injuries and changing roles while also showcasing flashes of brilliance. Last season with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/los-angeles-chargers/27">Los Angeles Chargers</a>, he posted his best fantasy season with 14.8 points per game, good for 18th. His future with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/denver-broncos/10">Denver Broncos</a> is uncertain, as he joins a crowded backfield with varied usage possibilities under Sean Payton's system, which historically has utilized multiple backs in different roles. Dobbins' fantasy relevance will largely hinge on how Denver structures its rushing attack and whether he can secure a consistent role, likely on early downs, although he could be lost in a rotation given the team's running back depth. While his range of outcomes is vast and projecting his weekly production will be challenging, there's a possibility he finishes as a top-24 fantasy running back in points per game if he can carve out a substantial role.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-travis-kelce-player-profile">Travis Kelce</a> consistently finished first or second in fantasy points per game for nearly a decade, but his quality of play and fantasy production have declined in recent seasons. His avoided tackle rate sharply declined last season, as did his yards after the catch per reception. Kelce will be 36 years old by the end of the season, making it unlikely these numbers bounce back in a significant way. The Chiefs also have several young wide receivers who are healthy together, which could also cut into Kelce’s production. Kelce is at risk of falling outside the top-10 fantasy tight ends, but if the team is scoring more points and Kelce is doubled in the red zone less often, that should lead to Kelce’s touchdown totals bouncing back.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-mark-andrews-player-profile">Mark Andrews</a> finished as a top-five fantasy tight end in points per game each year from 2019 to 2023. His fantasy value took a step back in 2024 for a multitude of reasons. The Ravens added <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-derrick-henry-player-profile">Derrick Henry</a>, leading the team to be more run-heavy. <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-isaiah-likely-player-profile">Isaiah Likely</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/charlie-kolar/60917">Charlie Kolar</a> were both playing well, leading Andrews to be mostly restricted to most of the 11 personnel snaps and nearly all of the 12 personnel snaps, but he wasn’t in 21 personnel very often and very rarely in 22. This led him to finish 14th among tight ends in receptions despite not missing a game. Luckily, the quality of his play didn’t take a step back, as he led all tight ends in touchdowns. His touchdown total will likely regress, but ideally, his talent can lead him to more opportunities. He’s a risky pick, but should remain a fantasy starter for another season.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/bo-nix/97790">Bo Nix</a> found a lot of success from a fantasy perspective as a rookie, finishing eighth in fantasy points per game. Typically, when rookie quarterbacks find success in fantasy football, it’s from being a dominant runner, but for Nix, it was a mix of a high passing touchdown rate and solid rushing. While Nix’s touchdown rate will likely regress, he should generally improve as a passer in his second season. The Broncos added receiving running back R.J. Harvey in the second round of the draft in addition to veteran tight end <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-evan-engram-player-profile">Evan Engram</a>, and both should be improvements over last season. The Broncos had the best pass-blocking offensive line last season, and it stayed relatively healthy. If Nix regresses this season, the most likely reason would be injuries to the line.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tuten was excellent at avoiding tackles in college, with 0.339 avoided tackles per attempt, ranking fourth-best among the rookie running backs. He joins a wide-open <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/jacksonville-jaguars/15">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> backfield, where he, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-travis-etienne-jr-player-profile">Travis Etienne Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-tank-bigsby-player-profile">Tank Bigsby</a> will compete for snaps on both early downs and passing downs. Tuten should be viewed more favorably than most handcuff running backs. Like all handcuffs, there is a chance he won’t hold any fantasy value this upcoming season, but there is also a path for significant playing time if he can simply outperform the other running backs on the roster.</p>

His fantasy value has slowly but surely declined as his rushing attempts per game have declined. There is some talk of him running more often this season, but it’s unlikely the increase will be overly significant. The Cardinals kept the same offensive coaching staff and personnel around Murray, so we are likely to get another season between 18-19 PPR points, making him one of the easiest to predict quarterbacks with the least variance.</p>

However, the team's first-round draft pick, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-rb-omarion-hampton-2025-player-profile">Omarion Hampton</a>, significantly diminishes Harris’ potential role. Hampton is projected to be the lead back, leaving Harris likely as a backup who should still receive some carries each week.

His quality play hasn’t necessarily led to fantasy success because he typically plays in three-receiver sets only, and the Bills are often winning games and don’t need to use 11 personnel as much as most teams. Shakir is a fine high-floor, low-ceiling WR3, but there isn’t much reason to expect his fantasy value to change from last season.</p>

Warren landed with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts/14">Indianapolis Colts</a>, where he should play a high percentage of snaps. While the Colts haven’t had an every-down tight end in recent seasons, head coach Shane Steichen utilized a feature tight end at both the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/los-angeles-chargers/27">Los Angeles Chargers</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/philadelphia-eagles/24">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. The primary concern is at quarterback, where <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/anthony-richardson/124393">Anthony Richardson Sr.</a> has the lowest accuracy rate on short targets among quarterbacks.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-caleb-williams-player-profile">Caleb Williams</a>, drafted first overall by the Bears, had a rough start to his rookie season but showed flashes of great quarterback play, ending up 22nd in fantasy points per game among quarterbacks. Williams showed flashes in a few starts, which led to both high PFF grades and top-six fantasy finishes. There are a lot of reasons for optimism with the addition of head coach <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ben-johnson/47039">Ben Johnson</a>, first-round pick tight end <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-cameron-ward-player-profile">Colston Loveland</a>, second-round pick wide receiver <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-luther-burden-iiis-player-profile">Luther Burden III</a> and guard <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/joe-thuney/10712">Joe Thuney</a>. However, Johnson’s offenses have been more run-heavy, so Williams will likely drop back to pass less often. He also took a lot of sacks, and the Bears' offensive line makeover helped their run blocking while hurting their pass protection. Williams’ fantasy production may get worse before it gets better. Williams is an excellent option for those in single-quarterback leagues who want to wait on quarterbacks. Anyone drafting Williams will need another option, just in case all of the new moving parts on offense need some time to work out. Williams has one of the clearest paths to be a top-five fantasy quarterback among those ranked outside of the top 10.</p>

Early in his career, he was consistently among the league leaders in dropbacks. That volume helped him be a top-five fantasy quarterback. However, last season under Greg Roman, the Chargers became more of a balanced team. Herbert played his best football on a per-play level in years, but that only cancelled out the decrease in dropbacks. The Chargers spent the offseason investing in two running backs and other offensive players who can help the run game, which will likely lead the Chargers to be more run-heavy this season.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-evan-engram-player-profile">Evan Engram</a> has spent his career among the league leaders in routes run per game. With the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/jacksonville-jaguars/15">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>, he parlayed that workload into being a consistent fantasy starter. In his final season with the team, Engram had only one game as a top-six fantasy tight end, with injuries costing him half the campaign and potentially impacting his quality of play in the other half. He signed a two-year contract with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/denver-broncos/10">Denver Broncos</a>, who have thrown the fewest passes to tight ends over the past two seasons.

While Engram should help the Broncos and provide a missing element to their offense, he will have trouble reaching the volume he's used to.

If <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/daniel-jones/39395">Daniel Jones</a> wins the Colts’ quarterback job, Downs has a chance to push his fantasy value even further. However, the <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-kaleb-johnson-player-profile">Tyler Warren</a> addition could mean a notable decrease in target share for Downs, just depending on how quickly Warren earns a receiving role in the offense.

After a quiet start to his career with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/denver-broncos/10">Denver Broncos</a>, Mims showed flashes late last season, particularly during a seven-game stretch where he was 23rd in PPR points per game with 15.5. He posted an elite 89.7 receiving grade during those seven games, finishing with a target on 30.4% of his routes, which led to 4.25 yards per route run. After being a deep threat earlier in his career, his average depth of target fell to 4.2 yards. His role expanded significantly in the playoffs, highlighted by a 69% snap rate. While the Broncos' wide receiver room has become more crowded, no one has the same size and speed as Mims in their offense.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-roschon-johnson-player-profile">Roschon Johnson</a> enters the 2025 season with the potential for a significantly expanded role in the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/chicago-bears/6">Chicago Bears</a>' offense, particularly if the team doesn't add another running back this offseason. While he's primarily been utilized as a passing-down and short-yardage back in his NFL career, Johnson profiles as a strong fit in the new <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ben-johnson/47039">Ben Johnson</a>-led scheme, which favors zone runs (where he averages 4.0 yards per carry). His proven ability near the goal line (eight career rushing touchdowns from the 1- or 2-yard line) suggests a more prominent role could be on the horizon. As a late-round fantasy option, he is a high-upside player but also one who can be quickly dropped if his role remains limited.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-jordan-love-player-profile">Jordan Love</a> became the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/green-bay-packers/12">Green Bay Packers</a>' starter in 2023, when he scored the sixth-most fantasy points per game thanks to throwing the second-most touchdowns and throwing a high volume of passes. Love’s yards per attempt improved in 2024, but his fantasy value took a step back. Love dealt with multiple injuries over the season, and the Packers added <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-josh-jacobs-player-profile">Josh Jacobs</a> at running back. This led the team to become more run-heavy, while Love ran the ball less often himself. With five fewer passing attempts per game, Love’s passing volume decreased, moving Love into the QB2 range. While Love should be healthier this season, Jacobs’ presence will still leave them throwing less often than in 2023. Love should be a fantasy starter if the matchup is right, but he will need to improve as a passer to return to being a must-start fantasy option.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-c-j-stroud-player-profile">C.J. Stroud</a> possesses undeniable talent, but his production has been inconsistent. As a rookie, he ranked among the top 10 in fantasy points per game and threw for at least 240 yards in 11 of 15 games, excelling on deep passes with 1,111 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. However, his second season saw a dip, especially during a seven-game stretch where he averaged only 12.7 points per game, coinciding with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-nico-collins-player-profile">Nico Collins</a>' injury. His deep ball success regressed to the mean. While his accuracy improved, the Texans need to convert more field goals into touchdowns to elevate Stroud to elite status. Concerns about the offensive line remain, potentially limiting his overall fantasy ceiling, despite some offseason changes in the receiver room.</p>

There is a chance the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/jacksonville-jaguars/15">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>' backfield is already Tuten’s to lose.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-tank-bigsby-player-profile">Tank Bigsby</a> was involved in too many turnovers as a rookie for him to get many opportunities. In his second season, he had stretches of the season where he was a borderline fantasy starter when <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-travis-etienne-jr-player-profile">Travis Etienne Jr.</a> was either injured or inefficient. The Jaguars spent a fourth-round pick on <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-bhayshul-tuten-player-profile">Bhayshul Tuten</a>, which further complicates the Jaguars' backfield. Bigsby’s lack of impact in the passing game is a major detriment to his fantasy value. Ideally, he will continue to be the Jaguars' goal-line back, and Jacksonville will play better under Liam Coen at head coach, leading to more touchdowns. He will need to see double-digit carries, and ideally average at least one reception per game in order to have fantasy value.</p>

He’s consistently been among the league’s highest-graded tight ends, although he’s fallen to the 10-15 range among tight ends the last two seasons. The Eagles have a lot of star power on offense, which is limiting Goedert’s touches, but defenses are so focused on everyone else that it’s making Goedert’s life easier when he is targeted. Goedert has been a low-end TE1 in fantasy points per game throughout his career, which should continue to be the case. Goedert has missed games every season since his rookie season, including a career-high seven games last season. Anyone drafting Goedert should have a second option at the position in case Goedert is injured, or sees further declines in his target rate or quality of play.</p>

After missing the first six weeks of the season, Pearsall became the team’s slot receiver over the rest of the season. He showed some sparks in his first few games, finishing with three to four receptions in his first three games. He was a non-factor in his next five games but ended the season strong with 14 receptions for 210 yards and two touchdowns in his final two games. The 49ers traded <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-deebo-samuel-player-profile">Deebo Samuel</a> but have <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-brandon-aiyuk-player-profile">Brandon Aiyuk</a> coming back from injury.

After a promising rookie season, Pitts has failed to finish among the top 12 fantasy tight ends in over 40% of his games in any of the last three seasons. Last season, he was playing three-quarters of Atlanta’s offensive snaps during the first half of the season, but that fell to half of the offensive snaps over the second half of the season, as the Falcons chose to utilize <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/charlie-woerner/42257">Charlie Woerner</a> more frequently for his run-blocking ability. Pitts shouldn’t be trusted to be a fantasy starter this season, but if he can earn the trust of his coaches and new quarterback <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-qb-michael-penix-jr-player-profile">Michael Penix Jr.</a>, there is room for him to earn more playing time and a higher target rate, which could be enough to be a fantasy starter again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-michael-pittman-jr-player-profile">Michael Pittman Jr.</a> was a wide receiver who could be consistently put in fantasy starting lineups from 2021 to 2023, regardless of which quarterback was throwing him the football. While he wasn’t a high-upside option, his floor was high, making him a safe player. This past season, Pittman played through a back injury. He could have chosen to have surgery, but he wanted to play through the pain, even though this hurt his fantasy value. Pittman should be back to normal in terms of health this season, but he has increased competition for targets with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-josh-downs-player-profile">Josh Downs</a> in the slot and rookie tight end <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-kaleb-johnson-player-profile">Tyler Warren</a>.

He is projected to be the top slot receiver. The Texans spend their second- and third-round picks on wide receivers, but Kirk should begin the season with the job, and if he keeps playing well, he should keep it. Kirk benefits from playing with quarterback <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-c-j-stroud-player-profile">C.J.

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Higgins was the 34th overall pick, and any wide receiver selected that high is worth the risk in fantasy. He is a prototypical X receiver at 6’4” and 217 pounds. While our draft guide compared him to <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tim-patrick/12087">Tim Patrick</a>, some others compared him to his new teammate, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-nico-collins-player-profile">Nico Collins</a>. It is very rare for a team to utilize two wide receivers who are typically X receivers on a high percentage of plays. Houston will likely use a four-man rotation at wide receiver, which could limit Higgins' playing time. Collins has missed time due to injury every season, in which case Higgins would likely take over as the centerpiece of the passing game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-jayden-reed-player-profile">Jayden Reed</a> earned the Packers' slot receiving job but has never expanded his role to playing in two-receiver sets. While Reed makes 30-plus-yard plays at a rate higher than all other receivers, his routes per game and targets per route are too low to have consistent fantasy value. He showed sparks at the end of 2023 when all other Packers skill players were dealing with injuries. In 2024, he gained over 100 receiving yards in half of the Packers' losses but averaged 33 receiving yards in all other games outside of those three losses. The Packers drafted two wide receivers early in the NFL draft, making it unlikely Reed sees an expanded role in Green Bay this season. Reed should be drafted as a backup option who can ideally be started in games where the Packers will need to pass the ball a lot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-keon-coleman-player-profile">Keon Coleman</a> spent his rookie year as the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills/4">Buffalo Bills</a>' starting X receiver, when healthy. There was a short stretch of games around October where Coleman was putting up numbers good enough to be a fantasy starter. This included a two-game stretch with nine receptions for 195 yards and a touchdown, but then he dealt with a wrist injury and was never able to gain that momentum back. He was used as a field-stretching X receiver with a high average depth of target and high deep target rate. These kinds of players typically aren’t great for fantasy, although Coleman’s target rate was higher than most of these kinds of receivers. While there is room for him to earn more targets, the Bills under Joe Brady have preferred to spread the ball around to several players. Coleman is unlikely to be someone to start every week in your fantasy league, but one to start if the matchup is right, with a high risk and high reward.</p>

It’s hard to trust these kinds of receivers for fantasy purposes. Shaheed seemed like he could be an exception last season, but now, he has a less-than-ideal quarterback situation. New head coach <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kellen-moore/7466">Kellen Moore</a> has never had a wide receiver like Shaheed, and most of his successful fantasy wide receivers have played predominantly out of the slot.

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-austin-ekeler-player-profile">Austin Ekeler</a>’s role with the Commanders is primarily as a receiving back, but with the addition of versatile wide receiver <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-deebo-samuel-player-profile">Deebo Samuel</a>, his fantasy value is taking a hit. The Commanders used a lot of two running back sets with <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-brian-robinson-jr-player-profile">Brian Robinson Jr.</a> and Ekeler. The Commanders will have more versatility using Samuel instead of Ekeler in that role. This will likely prevent Ekeler from finishing as a top-36 fantasy running back as frequently as last season. He remains Robinson’s handcuff, but his upside in the case of a Robinson injury is limited relative to other handcuffs. Last season, Ekeler’s efficiency suffered due to the Commanders' poor run blocking, as he averaged 7.6 yards per carry on perfectly blocked runs over the last three seasons but only 2.6 yards per carry on non-perfectly blocked runs. Injuries and age (30 years old) are also a concern, as Ekeler has suffered four concussions in his career, and two of them occurred last season.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-rico-dowdle-player-profile">Rico Dowdle</a> finds himself in a different situation for the 2025 fantasy season, landing with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/carolina-panthers/5">Carolina Panthers</a> as a backup to <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-chuba-hubbard-player-profile">Chuba Hubbard</a>.

On the bright side, Dowdle will run behind a Panthers offensive line that powered the team's 73.1 PFF run-blocking grade last season, which should aid his efficiency when he gets carries.</p>

<p>Our draft guide gave him perfect 10s in competitive toughness and his hands. Bech’s college career started with him ahead of <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-brian-thomas-jr-player-profile">Brian Thomas Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-malik-nabers-player-profile">Malik Nabers</a> on LSU’s depth chart. He spent a few years dealing with injuries, but ended his college career with an effective season at TCU. Bech landed on a Raiders team with a few stars that will be a bigger priority in the offense. Still, the opportunity for playing time is much larger than most wide receivers selected in the second round or later. The Raiders moved on from three of their top five wide receivers from last season and didn’t add any free agents. If Bech exceeds expectations, all he needs is a decent target rate to be a fantasy starter.</p>

His performance improved toward the end of last season, showing flashes of big-play ability with 13.9% of his receptions going for at least 30 yards, sixth-best among wide receivers, and he excelled when lined up out wide, boasting 1.51 yards per route run from that position. However, his fantasy outlook hinges significantly on the Steelers' potential trade activity, particularly for another wide receiver like <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/allen-lazard/48135">Allen Lazard</a> or <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-romeo-doubs-player-profile">Romeo Doubs</a>, which could drastically cut into his target share and determine whether the offensive scheme leans more toward <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-qb-aaron-rodgers-player-profile">Aaron Rodgers</a>' pass-heavy approach rather than Arthur Smith's run-centric tendencies.</p>

<p>Williams is an undersized receiver at 5-foot-1” and 190 pounds. He’s in the bottom 20th percentile in both arm length and hand size. He played primarily on the outside throughout his college career. Typically, receivers of his size are great against zone defense and struggle against man, but that was the opposite for Williams. He wasn’t given many opportunities out of the slot, but he thrived when given the opportunity. He joins a crowded wide receiver room with five wide receivers who averaged at least 22 routes per game over the last three seasons, and two recent high draft picks. It might take some time for Williams to work his way up the depth chart, but there is a chance Williams starts as a rookie.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-blake-corum-player-profile">Blake Corum</a> enters the 2025 fantasy football season in a precarious position, much like last year. His value hinges entirely on becoming the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/los-angeles-rams/26">Los Angeles Rams</a>' starting running back, a role currently held by <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-kyren-williams-player-profile">Kyren Williams</a>. Last season, Corum averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and primarily played only one drive per game until Week 18, when a forearm fracture prematurely ended his only start.

Rookie <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-jarquez-hunter-player-profile">Jarquez Hunter</a>'s presence makes it a little less likely that Corum will become the starter if he falls below Hunter on the depth chart. However, Williams hasn’t necessarily played well enough to remain the starter, and his contract year and situation could complicate matters for Williams. Corum remains a high-end handcuff who needs to overtake Williams to have any fantasy value.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-rashod-bateman-player-profile">Rashod Bateman</a> has shown flashes of potential as a deep threat for the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/baltimore-ravens/3">Baltimore Ravens</a>. He notably caught eight of 15 deep passes for 292 yards and five touchdowns last season, finishing with a 36.7-yard average depth of target on those deep targets, the most for a wide receiver with 15 or more deep targets. However, he's struggled to consistently produce for fantasy football, never truly establishing himself as a reliable starter in redraft leagues due to low route totals in the Ravens' run-first offense and a low target rate with significant competition for targets. While his high single coverage open rates and decent yards per route run suggest untapped potential, his role in the offense, the <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-deandre-hopkins-player-profile">DeAndre Hopkins</a> addition, will make it even harder for Bateman to receive more volume, even if he can improve on a per-target basis.

His standout performance came in Week 4 against the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/cincinnati-bengals/7">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, where he caught six passes for 66 yards and a touchdown. However, he only exceeded 10 PPR points from receptions and yards alone in that one game. While his playing time increased significantly midseason, his fantasy value didn't follow suit, and he struggled to get open consistently. There has been some general positive buzz about Legette this offseason. The Panthers moved him from Z to X midseason, which likely didn’t help. He will be moving back to Z this season with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-tetairoa-mcmillan-player-profile">Tetairoa McMillan</a> addition. Ultimately, if he makes these strides in Dave Canales' offense with <a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-qb-bryce-young-player-profile">Bryce Young</a>, he could become a valuable fantasy asset.</p>

<p>Bryant spent his four-year collegiate career at Illinois, working his way up the wide receiver depth chart. In 2024, he landed at the top of the depth chart and his 86.0 receiving grade was the best for an Illinois wide receiver in a season in PFF’s history. He played well on the outside against man coverage and struggles at separation, which makes him an X receiver candidate. However, the Broncos under Sean Payton have preferred taller receivers, which means Bryant may play anywhere in the formation. Typically, only one wide receiver in Bryant’s offense has been fantasy-relevant at a time because of his frequent rotation of players. This means Bryant will need to work his way to the top of the depth chart to be fantasy-relevant as a rookie.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-wandale-robinson-player-profile">Wan’Dale Robinson</a>, the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/new-york-giants/21">New York Giants</a>' slot receiver, had a notable 2024 season with 93 receptions on 132 targets for 699 yards and three touchdowns, making him a low-end WR3 in fantasy football. Despite a significant increase in receptions and targets, his catch rate declined due to a high rate of contested passes and seven dropped passes. He’s maintained a high rate of avoided tackles at 0.033 per route, the seventh-most among wide receivers during his career, and a high rate of gaining separation on plays where he’s expected to gain separation. The Giants are changing quarterbacks, and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/russell-wilson/7077">Russell Wilson</a> will likely to win the job. Recently, Wilson has both a high tendency to throw deep and a high tendency to check down to his running backs, which will likely lead to a decrease in targets for Robinson. However, the quality of passes should improve due to Wilson’s high short-yardage accuracy. This could put Robinson in the WR3 conversation, even though the odds of him being a top-24 fantasy wide receiver are very low.</p>

While his early career saw limited routes behind other tight ends, his per-play efficiency was undeniable, highlighted by his 2.62 yards per route run, which tied for the most in the last three seasons. Okonkwo has minimal competition for targets, and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-qb-cameron-ward-player-profile">Cameron Ward</a> is his new quarterback. If Okonkwo can keep his high snap rate from the end of last season and become one of Ward’s favorite targets, he has the potential to finish among the top-12 fantasy tight ends.</p>

His cleanest path to playing time with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/cleveland-browns/8">Cleveland Browns</a> could be as a receiver. He had the highest receiving grade of the Browns running backs and highest yards per route run, albeit both were in college compared to numbers in the pros. The biggest concern for all of the Browns' running backs is the offensive line.</p>

He scored eight touchdowns and had two huge games. His target rate increased, and his yards per route run more than doubled, but that ultimately left him in the WR4 range. The Chargers added three new receivers, two new running backs and two new tight ends. This should allow Greg Roman to run an offense more similar to his past teams, where the wide receivers, other than the top one on the depth chart, didn’t have much fantasy production. Johnston’s 711 receiving yards last season were the most for a second wide receiver in a Roman offense.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-jalen-mcmillan-player-profile">Jalen McMillan</a>, the 92nd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, initially struggled to find his footing but finished the 2024 NFL season strong, scoring the eighth-most fantasy points among wide receivers over his last five games. He demonstrated a knack for finding the end zone, with his 0.216 touchdowns per reception ranking third among wide receivers. Despite his late-season surge, McMillan faces a crowded Buccaneers wide receiver room in 2025, headlined by rookie <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-emeka-egbukas-player-profile">Emeka Egbuka</a>, a healthy <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-chris-godwin-player-profile">Chris Godwin</a> and veteran <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-mike-evans-player-profile">Mike Evans</a>, making his projected role uncertain. He was primarily a slot receiver in college and averaged 1.85 yards per route run in the slot compared to 0.96 when lined up out wide. Despite this, McMillan will likely play on the outside again, with both Godwin and Egbuka also playing better in the slot. Tampa Bay's offensive coaching staff changes, with Josh Grizzard taking over as offensive coordinator and the potential for increased wide receiver rotation, further complicate McMillan’s fantasy outlook. While there's potential for McMillan to become fantasy-relevant through injuries to other receivers, his current situation suggests fantasy managers should use no more than a late-round flier pick on him, perhaps as a handcuff option.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-alec-pierce-player-profile">Alec Pierce</a> is a risky fantasy option for 2025, as he is largely dependent on <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/anthony-richardson/124393">Anthony Richardson</a> remaining the Colts' quarterback. Pierce's usage as a deep threat, exemplified by his league-leading 22.8-yard average depth of target and 45.5% deep-target rate in 2024, makes him boom-or-bust. He had three games of 120-plus receiving yards and a touchdown and several games with minimal production last season. His 30.7 yards per win in 2024 and 67.7 yards per loss further highlight his reliance on comeback situations. While his upside is high with Richardson at the helm, <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/daniel-jones/39395">Daniel Jones</a> taking over quarterback duties would likely render Pierce irrelevant in fantasy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-rb-elijah-mitchell-player-profile">Elijah Mitchell</a>, a former sixth-round pick who initially impressed with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/san-francisco-49ers/28">San Francisco 49ers</a>, now faces an uncertain future with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/16">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. Despite flashes of brilliance, including averaging 79 rushing yards per start over the last five years, eighth-best among all running backs, Mitchell’s career has been plagued by injuries. After missing the entire 2024 season due to a hamstring injury, he joins a crowded Chiefs backfield where his role will hinge on his recovery and performance against competition like <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-isiah-pacheco-player-profile">Isiah Pacheco</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kareem-hunt/11841">Kareem Hunt</a>. Mitchell's high-risk, high-reward situation could see him become the Chiefs’ starting running back, fail to make the roster altogether, or anything in between. Luckily, we should have a good sense after Week 1 if Mitchell should remain on fantasy rosters or not.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Giddens was a solid runner during his three years at Kansas State, grading between 85.0-90.0 each season. He also showed some promise as a receiver with 1.24 yards per route run. He was selected in the fifth round by the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/indianapolis-colts/14">Indianapolis Colts</a>, where he has an opportunity to become both the third-down back and the primary backup if he can beat out free-agent addition <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/khalil-herbert/41668">Khalil Herbert</a>. Given Taylor’s recent injury history and declining quality of play, there is a chance there will be games this season with Giddens as the feature back, making him a fine late-round dart throw.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-kendre-miller-player-profile">Kendre Miller</a> presents a high-risk, high-reward late-round option at running back.. While he boasts impressive per-play numbers, including ranking in the top six in both avoided tackles per run and yards per route run over the last two seasons, his extensive injury history and the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/devin-neal/144558">Devin Neal</a> addition cast uncertainty over his role. There is at least a chance he can outplay <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-alvin-kamara-player-profile">Alvin Kamara</a> in the run game, potentially allowing him to lead the team in carries. The two have identical yards per carry, while Miller has earned more yards after contact per attempt and twice as many avoided tackles per run. Miller has a slightly higher first-down rate. There is a seven-year age gap between Kamara and Miller, so Miller is more likely to improve while Kamara is more likely to decline. However, there is also a chance Neal or <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/clyde-edwards-helaire/57279">Clyde Edwards-Helaire</a> can overtake Miller for the backup job.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.pff.com/new/fantasy-football-2025-wr-deandre-hopkins-player-profile">DeAndre Hopkins</a>, a future Hall of Fame wide receiver, has seen his fantasy value decline despite his past dominance. After being a top-five fantasy receiver in five of six seasons from 2015 to 2020, his recent years have been marked by injuries and decreased playing time, culminating in just 9.2 fantasy points per game in 2024, 60th-best among wide receivers. Now with the <a href="https://www.pff.com/nfl/teams/baltimore-ravens/3">Baltimore Ravens</a> on a one-year deal, his role is uncertain in a crowded offense with players like <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-rashod-bateman-player-profile">Rashod Bateman</a>, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-wr-zay-flowers-player-profile">Zay Flowers</a>, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-mark-andrews-player-profile">Mark Andrews</a>, <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-te-isaiah-likely-player-profile">Isaiah Likely</a> and <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/fantasy-football-2025-rb-derrick-henry-player-profile">Derrick Henry</a>. While his 0.44 fantasy points per route over the past five seasons remains 11th-best among wide receivers, he faces competition for targets and playing time, making him a risky fantasy option, outside of DFS and best ball, though a WR3 season is possible if he takes the starting role from Bateman.</p>
