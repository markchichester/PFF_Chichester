The Eagles finished with a 7-6 record for the second straight season. In Week 3, Boston College was ranked No. 24 in the AP poll, marking the first time in six years that the program cracked the top 25.\n\nBoston College’s defense was the biggest reason for its success, ranking 31st in the nation in EPA per play. That unit returns a strong secondary but has some concerns up front, as the defensive line lost all four starters, including a couple of stars.\n\nO'Brien helped quarterback Tommy Castellanos improve his PFF passing grade by 17.1 points, but he transferred to Florida State this offseason. O'Brien will now have to rely on Dylan Lonergan with a rebuilt offensive line in front of him, though the Eagles do return most of their weaponry.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Dylan Lonergan can deliver above-average play at quarterback, Boston College can make its third straight bowl game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-boston-college-eagles"}, {"Title": "California Golden Bears", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/25.png", "Team color": "#031522", "2024 Recap": "California’s first season as a member of the ACC mirrored its final year in the Pac-12: a 6-7 record with a bowl loss. The Golden Bears have now had five consecutive losing seasons under Justin Wilcox. His defense wasn’t to blame in 2024, finishing 35th in EPA allowed per play. The offense didn’t pull its weight, averaging just 25.1 points per game (90th).\n\nThere are even more concerns on that side of the ball after the program lost so much talent to the transfer portal, but the defense again looks strong up front. California’s chances of making a third straight bowl game likely hinge on whether true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele can live up to the hype.", "2025 Bottom line": "California’s strong defense may be enough for the team to claw its way to a few wins, but the Golden Bears will need some new faces on offense to step up if the program is to make a bowl game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-california-golden-bears"}, {"Title": "Clemson Tigers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png", "Team color": "#F66733", "2024 Recap": "The 2023 season marked the first time Clemson didn’t win 10 games since 2010. Because of that, the program donned its lowest preseason ranking in a decade entering 2024 (No. 14).\n\nThe Tigers got back on track last year by winning their eighth ACC title over the past 10 years and thereby clinching their seventh playoff spot. Since Clemson brings back almost everyone from last year’s squad, the Tigers are the clear favorite to win the ACC and are one of the top contenders to win the national championship. Clemson has PFF’s best offense and the third-best defense in college football heading into 2025.", "2025 Bottom line": "With a loaded roster and very few holes, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney has his sights set on bringing home a third national championship.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-clemson-tigers"}, {"Title": "Duke Blue Devils", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/150.png", "Team color": "#001A57", "2024 Recap": "Manny Diaz’s first season as Duke’s head coach matched the success of his predecessor, Mike Elko. Duke finished with a 9-4 record in 2024, tying for its best record in 11 years. Diaz is known as a defensive mastermind, and that was apparent last year, as the Blue Devils were among the 25 best schools in both PFF defensive grade and EPA per play.\n\nThe offense lagged behind, finishing as one of the 15 worst units in the nation in EPA per play. A new quarterback in Tulane transfer Darian Mensah has Duke fans hoping for improvement on that side of the ball, while an elite secondary will allow Diaz to blitz as much as he desires.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Mensah can live up to his massive NIL deal, Duke is a sleeper to make the ACC Championship game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-duke-blue-devils"}, {"Title": "Florida State Seminoles", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/52.png", "Team color": "#782F40", "2024 Recap": "There’s no way around it: The 2024 season was a disaster for Florida State. After winning the ACC Championship in 2023 and finishing with a 13-1 record overall, the Seminoles entered 2024 as the No. 10 team in the preseason AP poll. But their brand new roster ultimately fell flat with just a 2-10 record, the program’s worst in 50 years.\n\nWith pressure now mounting in Year 6, Mike Norvell brought in 23 transfers and coordinators Gus Malzahn (offense) and Tony White (defense). Those new faces should help the Seminoles at least reach bowl eligibility in 2025, but new quarterback Tommy Castellanos will determine the program’s true ceiling.", "2025 Bottom line": "It’s hard to envision another catastrophic season for Florida State. But it’s also very unlikely that the Seminoles will get back to competing for an ACC title and a College Football Playoff spot.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-florida-state-seminoles"}, {"Title": "Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/59.png", "Team color": "#00223e", "2024 Recap": "Brent Key has now gone 7-6 in both of his full seasons as Georgia Tech’s head coach. It's the first time the Yellow Jackets have had back-to-back winning campaigns in a decade.\n\nGeorgia Tech’s offense was the biggest reason for the program’s success last year, finishing as one of the 25 most efficient units in the nation last year by EPA per play. The defense lagged behind, particularly against opposing passing attacks. The 2025 version of the Yellow Jackets has the same strengths and weaknesses, which means the program could experience similar results in the win/loss column.", "2025 Bottom line": "Georgia Tech should have one of the most explosive offenses in the ACC if its offensive line can hold up. For the Yellow Jackets to take the next step and compete for a spot in the conference title game, they’ll need their defense to keep pace.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-georgia-tech-yellow-jackets"}, {"Title": "Louisville Cardinals", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/97.png", "Team color": "#ad000a", "2024 Recap": "Jeff Brohm has been highly successful through two seasons as Louisville’s head coach. After leading the Cardinals to their first ACC Championship Game in 2023, he followed that up with a 9-4 record and a thrilling Sun Bowl victory over Washington in 2024. The Cardinals' 19-8 mark over the past two seasons is their best two-year stretch in a decade, dating back to when Teddy Bridgewater was at quarterback.\n\nLouisville enters 2025 with similar expectations, thanks to what should be an elite rushing attack led by sophomores Isaac Brown and Duke Watson. Complementing the ground game is USC transfer Miller Moss, who takes over at quarterback. The Cardinals also return a strong front seven on defense but will need new faces in the secondary to step up.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Miller Moss can reach the heights Tyler Shough hit under Jeff Brohm, Louisville has a legitimate shot at making its second ACC Championship Game in three years.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-louisville-cardinals"}, {"Title": "Miami Hurricanes", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2390.png", "Team color": "#004325", "2024 Recap": "While Miami enjoyed its best season in seven years, 2024 still felt like the one that got away. Despite fielding the nation’s most efficient offense in terms of EPA per play and having future No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward at quarterback, the Hurricanes lost three games and missed out on both the ACC Championship Game and the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe biggest culprit was the secondary, which ranked just 67th in team coverage grade last season. Ward is now with the Tennessee Titans, but Miami landed a top-tier replacement in Georgia transfer Carson Beck. The No. 3-ranked quarterback in the country owns a 90.9 grade since 2023, the second-best among all returning FBS quarterbacks. If the Hurricanes can develop reliable pass-catchers and the revamped secondary takes a step forward, they’ll be a top contender in the ACC.", "2025 Bottom line": "If the 2023 version of Carson Beck shows up, Miami can make some serious noise in the College Football Playoff. If not, the Hurricanes will likely settle for being one of the better teams in the ACC.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-miami-fl-hurricanes"}, {"Title": "North Carolina Tar Heels", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/153.png", "Team color": "#99bfe5", "2024 Recap": "Following a 17-10 record in the two years with Drake Maye as its quarterback, North Carolina struggled in his absence with just a 6-7 mark this past season. The Tar Heels were forced to start three different quarterbacks last year, which led to their 102nd ranking in team PFF passing grade. Legendary coach Mack Brown was fired before the Fenway Bowl, and North Carolina replaced him with an even bigger legend in Bill Belichick.\n\nThe six-time Super Bowl champion is widely regarded as the greatest coach in NFL history and will now be coaching in the college ranks for the first time in his career. He and the Tar Heels were busy in the transfer portal, adding 13 projected starters, including a new quarterback in Gio Lopez.", "2025 Bottom line": "Belichick’s transition to the college game is one of the most fascinating storylines to follow this season. While it’s unlikely that he’ll have the Tar Heels competing for an ACC title, a winning season could certainly be in the cards.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-north-carolina-tar-heels"}, {"Title": "North Carolina State Wolfpack", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/152.png", "Team color": "#EF1216", "2024 Recap": "NC State had been a well-oiled machine under head coach Dave Doeren entering the 2024 season. The Wolfpack produced a winning record in nine of the 10 years before this past season but finished just 6-7.\n\nThe offense and defense shared the blame, each ranking outside the top 85 in EPA per play. There’s optimism for 2025, though, as quarterback CJ Bailey is back for his sophomore campaign after a very encouraging true freshman season. NC State also has a top-five tight end in all of college football and some solid pieces defensively. ", "2025 Bottom line": "If Bailey takes the next step as a sophomore, NC State could return to its winning ways and be a fringe top-25 program once again.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-nc-state-wolfpack"}, {"Title": "Pittsburgh Panthers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/221.png", "Team color": "#003263", "2024 Recap": "The 2024 season was a tale of two halves for Pittsburgh. The Panthers opened 7-0 and climbed as high as No. 18 in the AP Poll before dropping their final six games. Despite the brutal finish, Pitt’s 7-6 record marked a clear step forward from its 3-9 campaign in 2023.\n\nThe Panthers have now posted winning records in five of the last six seasons under Pat Narduzzi and will aim to continue that trend in 2025. To get there, they’ll need major strides on offense after finishing just 114th in overall PFF grade last season.", "2025 Bottom line": "Pittsburgh will need multiple players beyond Desmond Reid to step up offensively if the Panthers are to secure another winning season.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-pittsburgh-panthers"}, {"Title": "Smu Mustangs", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2567.png", "Team color": "#E32F38", "2024 Recap": "SMU’s first season in the ACC couldn’t have gone much better. The Mustangs finished 11-3, made the College Football Playoff and posted their best campaign in 40 years. A controversial early-season quarterback switch paid off, as Kevin Jennings finished 10th among FBS quarterbacks in PFF passing grade (85.0).\n\nHis return, along with several key contributors, gives SMU hope for another playoff push. However, lingering questions at the skill positions could keep the Mustangs from getting there.", "2025 Bottom line": "Even if SMU falls short of another College Football Playoff berth, there’s still enough talent on this roster to remain one of the ACC’s top teams.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-smu-mustangs"}, {"Title": "Stanford Cardinal", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/24.png", "Team color": "#A80532", "2024 Recap": "Stanford’s first season in the ACC looked much like its final three in the Pac-12. The Cardinal finished 3-9 for the fourth consecutive year, marking the program’s worst four-year stretch since 1958–61. In search of a new direction, Stanford brought in former star quarterback Andrew Luck as its general manager.\n\nOne of Luck's first moves was firing head coach Troy Taylor. He then hired Frank Reich — his former head coach with the Indianapolis Colts in 2019 — as Stanford’s interim coach. Reich, who brings six years of NFL head coaching experience, faces an uphill battle revitalizing an offense that struggled last season and now enters 2025 without its starting quarterback and top two receivers.", "2025 Bottom line": "With Andrew Luck now leading the program, there’s renewed optimism at Stanford. However, rebuilding will take time, and 2025 could bring another challenging season for the Cardinal.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-stanford-cardinal"}, {"Title": "Syracuse Orange", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/183.png", "Team color": "#F37321", "2024 Recap": "Despite never having been a head coach before, Fran Brown hit the ground running in his first year at Syracuse. The Orange finished 10-3 and ranked No. 20 in the final AP Poll, their best season in six years. A major reason for that success was Ohio State transfer quarterback Kyle McCord, who led the nation with 4,779 passing yards — 466 more than any other player.\n\nWhile McCord is now gone, Syracuse could still field a strong passing attack in 2025 with Notre Dame transfer Steve Angeli under center and a promising group of wide receivers. Improvement on defense will be key, particularly along the defensive front. Unfortunately for the Orange, they face the toughest schedule in the ACC, with nearly all of their biggest games scheduled to take place on the road.", "2025 Bottom line": "While Syracuse enjoyed a remarkable 2024 season, matching that success in 2025 will be a challenge given the number of new pieces and a brutal schedule.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-syracuse-orange"}, {"Title": "Virginia Cavaliers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/258.png", "Team color": "#00204e", "2024 Recap": "After back-to-back three-win seasons to begin his tenure, Tony Elliott showed progress in Year 3 with a 5-7 record. Still, it wasn’t enough to secure a bowl bid, and Virginia remains without a postseason appearance since the 2019 Orange Bowl.\n\nThere’s reason for optimism in 2025, as the Cavaliers appear to have upgraded at quarterback, along the offensive line, and in the secondary through the transfer portal. However, questions still remain about the team’s offensive weapons.", "2025 Bottom line": "Year 4 is shaping up to be a make-or-break season for Tony Elliott. If he can’t guide Virginia to at least a bowl game, the Cavaliers may be looking for a new head coach in 2026.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-virginia-cavaliers"}, {"Title": "Virginia Tech Hokies", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/259.png", "Team color": "#74232D", "2024 Recap": "Even with most of the 2023 roster returning in 2024, Virginia Tech disappointed under Brent Pry with just a 6-7 record. The Hokies have now failed to crack the top 25 across his three years in Blacksburg, the program's longest drought since 1990 to 1992.\n\nWith pressure mounting in 2025, Pry will need this program to take the next step. Virginia Tech did a solid job in the transfer portal, bringing in underrated stars like Tomas Rimac, Ben Bell and Terion Stewart. The Hokies will need quarterback Kyron Drones and their passing attack to improve if they want to avoid mediocrity once again.", "2025 Bottom line": "Virginia Tech’s season largely hinges on its passing game. If Drones and the receivers can significantly improve, the Hokies can be a dangerous team in the ACC.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-virginia-tech-hokies"}, {"Title": "Wake Forest Demon Deacons", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/154.png", "Team color": "#9E7E38", "2024 Recap": "Wake Forest thrived in 2021 and 2022, compiling a 19-8 record over those two seasons. But after back-to-back 4-8 campaigns, longtime head coach Dave Clawson stepped down after 11 years at the helm. The Demon Deacons filled that spot by hiring Jake Dickert, who posted a solid four-year run at Washington State, including an 8-4 record in his final season.\n\nA defensive-minded coach, Dickert should appreciate the talent returning at the second and third levels of Wake Forest’s defense. On the other side of the ball, new offensive coordinator Rob Ezell faces a tall task revamping a passing game full of new faces.", "2025 Bottom line": "Jake Dickert will look to lean on his defense and run game in 2025, but unless Wake Forest finds answers in the passing attack, the Demon Deacons risk missing a bowl game for the third straight season.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-wake-forest-demon-deacons"}]}, "Big 12": {"logo": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Big_12_Conference_%28cropped%29_logo.svg/2560px-Big_12_Conference_%28cropped%29_logo.svg.png", "teams": [{"Title": "Arizona Wildcats", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/12.png", "Team color": "#002449", "2024 Recap": "Arizona surprised the college football world in 2023, finishing 10–3 and ranking No. 11 in the final AP poll — its best season of the 21st century. Even after head coach Jedd Fisch departed for Washington, expectations remained high with stars returning like quarterback Noah Fifita, wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan and cornerback Tacario Davis. But under new coach Brent Brennan, the Wildcats fell back to Earth, finishing 4–8 in 2024, their sixth losing season in seven years. McMillan emerged as one of the few bright spots and was selected No. 8 overall by the Carolina Panthers in the 2025 NFL Draft. Still, there’s reason for cautious optimism: if Fifita can rebound and the defense strengthens, Arizona could be back in the bowl picture.", "2025 Bottom line": "Losing a superstar like Tetairoa McMillan is a blow, but Arizona can still hope for a bowl game with Noah Fifita returning and some promising offensive weapons. However, a shaky defense will likely limit the Wildcats' ceiling.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-arizona-wildcats"}, {"Title": "Arizona State Sun Devils", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/9.png", "Team color": "#942139", "2024 Recap": "Following back-to-back 3-9 campaigns, expectations were low for Arizona State in 2024. The Sun Devils were even picked to finish last in the Big 12 in the preseason media poll. ASU smashed those expectations by winning the conference in its first year as a member and taking Texas to double overtime in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals.
