The Eagles finished with a 7-6 record for the second straight season. In Week 3, Boston College was ranked No. 24 in the AP poll, marking the first time in six years that the program cracked the top 25.\n\nBoston College\u2019s defense was the biggest reason for its success, ranking 31st in the nation in EPA per play. That unit returns a strong secondary but has some concerns up front, as the defensive line lost all four starters, including a couple of stars.\n\nO'Brien helped quarterback Tommy Castellanos improve his PFF passing grade by 17.1 points, but he transferred to Florida State this offseason. O'Brien will now have to rely on Dylan Lonergan with a rebuilt offensive line in front of him, though the Eagles do return most of their weaponry.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Dylan Lonergan can deliver above-average play at quarterback, Boston College can make its third straight bowl game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-boston-college-eagles"}, {"Title": "California Golden Bears", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/25.png", "Team color": "#031522", "2024 Recap": "California\u2019s first season as a member of the ACC mirrored its final year in the Pac-12: a 6-7 record with a bowl loss. The Golden Bears have now had five consecutive losing seasons under Justin Wilcox. His defense wasn\u2019t to blame in 2024, finishing 35th in EPA allowed per play. The offense didn\u2019t pull its weight, averaging just 25.1 points per game (90th).\n\nThere are even more concerns on that side of the ball after the program lost so much talent to the transfer portal, but the defense again looks strong up front. California\u2019s chances of making a third straight bowl game likely hinge on whether true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele can live up to the hype.", "2025 Bottom line": "California\u2019s strong defense may be enough for the team to claw its way to a few wins, but the Golden Bears will need some new faces on offense to step up if the program is to make a bowl game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-california-golden-bears"}, {"Title": "Clemson Tigers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/228.png", "Team color": "#F66733", "2024 Recap": "The 2023 season marked the first time Clemson didn\u2019t win 10 games since 2010. Because of that, the program donned its lowest preseason ranking in a decade entering 2024 (No. 14).\n\nThe Tigers got back on track last year by winning their eighth ACC title over the past 10 years and thereby clinching their seventh playoff spot. Since Clemson brings back almost everyone from last year\u2019s squad, the Tigers are the clear favorite to win the ACC and are one of the top contenders to win the national championship. Clemson has PFF\u2019s best offense and the third-best defense in college football heading into 2025.", "2025 Bottom line": "With a loaded roster and very few holes, Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney has his sights set on bringing home a third national championship.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-clemson-tigers"}, {"Title": "Duke Blue Devils", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/150.png", "Team color": "#001A57", "2024 Recap": "Manny Diaz\u2019s first season as Duke\u2019s head coach matched the success of his predecessor, Mike Elko. Duke finished with a 9-4 record in 2024, tying for its best record in 11 years. Diaz is known as a defensive mastermind, and that was apparent last year, as the Blue Devils were among the 25 best schools in both PFF defensive grade and EPA per play.\n\nThe offense lagged behind, finishing as one of the 15 worst units in the nation in EPA per play. A new quarterback in Tulane transfer Darian Mensah has Duke fans hoping for improvement on that side of the ball, while an elite secondary will allow Diaz to blitz as much as he desires.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Mensah can live up to his massive NIL deal, Duke is a sleeper to make the ACC Championship game.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-duke-blue-devils"}, {"Title": "Florida State Seminoles", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/52.png", "Team color": "#782F40", "2024 Recap": "There\u2019s no way around it: The 2024 season was a disaster for Florida State. After winning the ACC Championship in 2023 and finishing with a 13-1 record overall, the Seminoles entered 2024 as the No. 10 team in the preseason AP poll. But their brand new roster ultimately fell flat with just a 2-10 record, the program\u2019s worst in 50 years.\n\nWith pressure now mounting in Year 6, Mike Norvell brought in 23 transfers and coordinators Gus Malzahn (offense) and Tony White (defense). Those new faces should help the Seminoles at least reach bowl eligibility in 2025, but new quarterback Tommy Castellanos will determine the program\u2019s true ceiling.", "2025 Bottom line": "It\u2019s hard to envision another catastrophic season for Florida State. But it\u2019s also very unlikely that the Seminoles will get back to competing for an ACC title and a College Football Playoff spot.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-florida-state-seminoles"}, {"Title": "Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/59.png", "Team color": "#00223e", "2024 Recap": "Brent Key has now gone 7-6 in both of his full seasons as Georgia Tech\u2019s head coach. It's the first time the Yellow Jackets have had back-to-back winning campaigns in a decade.\n\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s offense was the biggest reason for the program\u2019s success last year, finishing as one of the 25 most efficient units in the nation last year by EPA per play. The defense lagged behind, particularly against opposing passing attacks. The 2025 version of the Yellow Jackets has the same strengths and weaknesses, which means the program could experience similar results in the win/loss column.", "2025 Bottom line": "Georgia Tech should have one of the most explosive offenses in the ACC if its offensive line can hold up. For the Yellow Jackets to take the next step and compete for a spot in the conference title game, they\u2019ll need their defense to keep pace.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-georgia-tech-yellow-jackets"}, {"Title": "Louisville Cardinals", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/97.png", "Team color": "#ad000a", "2024 Recap": "Jeff Brohm has been highly successful through two seasons as Louisville\u2019s head coach. After leading the Cardinals to their first ACC Championship Game in 2023, he followed that up with a 9-4 record and a thrilling Sun Bowl victory over Washington in 2024. The Cardinals' 19-8 mark over the past two seasons is their best two-year stretch in a decade, dating back to when Teddy Bridgewater was at quarterback.\n\nLouisville enters 2025 with similar expectations, thanks to what should be an elite rushing attack led by sophomores Isaac Brown and Duke Watson. Complementing the ground game is USC transfer Miller Moss, who takes over at quarterback. The Cardinals also return a strong front seven on defense but will need new faces in the secondary to step up.", "2025 Bottom line": "If Miller Moss can reach the heights Tyler Shough hit under Jeff Brohm, Louisville has a legitimate shot at making its second ACC Championship Game in three years.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-louisville-cardinals"}, {"Title": "Miami Hurricanes", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2390.png", "Team color": "#004325", "2024 Recap": "While Miami enjoyed its best season in seven years, 2024 still felt like the one that got away. Despite fielding the nation\u2019s most efficient offense in terms of EPA per play and having future No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward at quarterback, the Hurricanes lost three games and missed out on both the ACC Championship Game and the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe biggest culprit was the secondary, which ranked just 67th in team coverage grade last season. Ward is now with the Tennessee Titans, but Miami landed a top-tier replacement in Georgia transfer Carson Beck. The No. 3-ranked quarterback in the country owns a 90.9 grade since 2023, the second-best among all returning FBS quarterbacks. If the Hurricanes can develop reliable pass-catchers and the revamped secondary takes a step forward, they\u2019ll be a top contender in the ACC.", "2025 Bottom line": "If the 2023 version of Carson Beck shows up, Miami can make some serious noise in the College Football Playoff. If not, the Hurricanes will likely settle for being one of the better teams in the ACC.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-miami-fl-hurricanes"}, {"Title": "North Carolina Tar Heels", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/153.png", "Team color": "#99bfe5", "2024 Recap": "Following a 17-10 record in the two years with Drake Maye as its quarterback, North Carolina struggled in his absence with just a 6-7 mark this past season. The Tar Heels were forced to start three different quarterbacks last year, which led to their 102nd ranking in team PFF passing grade. Legendary coach Mack Brown was fired before the Fenway Bowl, and North Carolina replaced him with an even bigger legend in Bill Belichick.\n\nThe six-time Super Bowl champion is widely regarded as the greatest coach in NFL history and will now be coaching in the college ranks for the first time in his career. He and the Tar Heels were busy in the transfer portal, adding 13 projected starters, including a new quarterback in Gio Lopez.", "2025 Bottom line": "Belichick\u2019s transition to the college game is one of the most fascinating storylines to follow this season. While it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll have the Tar Heels competing for an ACC title, a winning season could certainly be in the cards.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-north-carolina-tar-heels"}, {"Title": "North Carolina State Wolfpack", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/152.png", "Team color": "#EF1216", "2024 Recap": "NC State had been a well-oiled machine under head coach Dave Doeren entering the 2024 season. The Wolfpack produced a winning record in nine of the 10 years before this past season but finished just 6-7.\n\nThe offense and defense shared the blame, each ranking outside the top 85 in EPA per play. There\u2019s optimism for 2025, though, as quarterback CJ Bailey is back for his sophomore campaign after a very encouraging true freshman season. NC State also has a top-five tight end in all of college football and some solid pieces defensively. ", "2025 Bottom line": "If Bailey takes the next step as a sophomore, NC State could return to its winning ways and be a fringe top-25 program once again.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-nc-state-wolfpack"}, {"Title": "Pittsburgh Panthers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/221.png", "Team color": "#003263", "2024 Recap": "The 2024 season was a tale of two halves for Pittsburgh. The Panthers opened 7-0 and climbed as high as No. 18 in the AP Poll before dropping their final six games. Despite the brutal finish, Pitt\u2019s 7-6 record marked a clear step forward from its 3-9 campaign in 2023.\n\nThe Panthers have now posted winning records in five of the last six seasons under Pat Narduzzi and will aim to continue that trend in 2025. To get there, they\u2019ll need major strides on offense after finishing just 114th in overall PFF grade last season.", "2025 Bottom line": "Pittsburgh will need multiple players beyond Desmond Reid to step up offensively if the Panthers are to secure another winning season.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-pittsburgh-panthers"}, {"Title": "Smu Mustangs", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2567.png", "Team color": "#E32F38", "2024 Recap": "SMU\u2019s first season in the ACC couldn\u2019t have gone much better. The Mustangs finished 11-3, made the College Football Playoff and posted their best campaign in 40 years. A controversial early-season quarterback switch paid off, as Kevin Jennings finished 10th among FBS quarterbacks in PFF passing grade (85.0).\n\nHis return, along with several key contributors, gives SMU hope for another playoff push. However, lingering questions at the skill positions could keep the Mustangs from getting there.", "2025 Bottom line": "Even if SMU falls short of another College Football Playoff berth, there\u2019s still enough talent on this roster to remain one of the ACC\u2019s top teams.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-smu-mustangs"}, {"Title": "Stanford Cardinal", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/24.png", "Team color": "#A80532", "2024 Recap": "Stanford\u2019s first season in the ACC looked much like its final three in the Pac-12.

While the 2025 Rebels aren\u2019t nearly as stacked, there\u2019s still enough talent on the roster for head coach Lane Kiffin to secure another top-25 finish.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-ole-miss-rebels"}, {"Title": "Mississippi State Bulldogs", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/344.png", "Team color": "#762123", "2024 Recap": "The Jeff Lebby era at Mississippi State got off to a rocky start, as the Bulldogs finished 2-10 in his first season, tying the program\u2019s worst record in 36 years. Lebby\u2019s offense was at least serviceable in 2024, ranking 69th nationally in EPA per play. But it was the Bulldogs\u2019 defensive struggles that doomed them, as they finished ninth-worst in the country and third-worst in the Power Four in EPA allowed per play.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s offense should deliver a similar output in 2025, even after losing three of its top four receivers, thanks in part to quarterback Blake Shapen returning from a season-ending shoulder injury. The addition of transfer running back Fluff Bothwell should also bolster the ground game. Still, unless the defense makes significant strides, the Bulldogs are likely headed for another year among the Power Four\u2019s worst teams.", "2025 Bottom line": "Mississippi State has reasons for optimism on offense with quarterback Blake Shapen returning and Fluff Bothwell joining the backfield.

They finished 10-3 and ranked No. 22 in the final AP poll, marking their second consecutive double-digit win season and top-25 finish \u2014 something the program hadn\u2019t achieved in a decade.\n\nMissouri will have to replace several key contributors from that squad, with only two of its 10 most valuable players returning. A strong transfer portal haul should help offset those losses and keep Eli Drinkwitz\u2019s program trending upward.", "2025 Bottom line": "While Missouri is unlikely to contend for a College Football Playoff spot, the Tigers have enough talent on both sides of the ball to secure a bowl berth and remain a tough out in the SEC.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-missouri-tigers"}, {"Title": "Oklahoma Sooners", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/201.png", "Team color": "#7b0000", "2024 Recap": "Oklahoma took a major step forward in Year 2 under Brent Venables, finishing 10-3 in 2023, but the program came crashing back to earth last season.

For context, Oklahoma hadn\u2019t posted a losing season in the entire 21st century before his arrival.\n\nA disastrous, injury-plagued offense was the primary culprit. The Sooners\u2019 60.2 offensive grade ranked dead last in the Power Four. It was their defense that kept the program afloat, as they finished 12th nationally with a 91.4 grade. That unit remains a strength heading into 2025, but Oklahoma\u2019s hopes of rebounding rest on transfers like quarterback John Mateer and running back Jaydn Ott jump-starting an offense that still has major question marks.", "2025 Bottom line": "Oklahoma is poised to play a smashmouth brand of football in 2025, leaning on its defense and what is projected to be a dynamic ground game.

The Gamecocks\u2019 resurgence was fueled by a defense that tied for eighth nationally in PFF grade (91.8).\n\nWhile South Carolina lost significant talent on that side of the ball, it returns one of the nation\u2019s premier players in sophomore edge defender Dylan Stewart. His continued development\u2014along with the growth of quarterback LaNorris Sellers and wideout Nyck Harbor\u2014will be key to the Gamecocks\u2019 hopes of breaking into the expanded 12-team College Football Playoff in 2025.", "2025 Bottom line": "If LaNorris Sellers can become more consistent as a passer and turn into the first-round quarterback many think he can be, South Carolina has the talent to get over the hump and break into the College Football Playoff.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-south-carolina-gamecocks"}, {"Title": "Tennessee Volunteers", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2633.png", "Team color": "#EE9627", "2024 Recap": "Tennessee enjoyed another strong season under Josh Heupel, reaching the inaugural 12-team College Football Playoff before falling to eventual national champion Ohio State.

That unit should remain a strength in 2025 with several key contributors returning. The offense, however, faces more uncertainty following the departures of star running back Dylan Sampson to the Cleveland Browns and quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who transferred to UCLA.", "2025 Bottom line": "Tennessee\u2019s defense will be good enough to keep the team in top-25 contention, but there are far too many questions hovering around the offense to expect the Volunteers to make it back to the College Football Playoff.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-tennessee-volunteers"}, {"Title": "Texas Longhorns", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/251.png", "Team color": "#EE7524", "2024 Recap": "Texas has solidified its status as a perennial national championship contender under head coach Steve Sarkisian, reaching back-to-back College Football Playoff semifinals.

The heir to his family\u2019s quarterback legacy showed promise in limited action last season, earning an 88.0 PFF grade that ranked 12th among FBS quarterbacks with at least 100 dropbacks. He\u2019ll work behind an almost entirely rebuilt offensive line but will have the benefit of a top-10 backfield and receiving corps.\n\nStill, Texas\u2019 biggest strength in 2025 might be its defense.

That success is even more impressive considering redshirt freshman Marcel Reed started most of the season at quarterback after beginning the year as the backup. Reed is a dynamic runner, but for Texas A&M\u2019s offense to reach its ceiling, he\u2019ll need to take a step forward as a passer to fully leverage the high-end talent around him.\n\nDefensively, the Aggies lost some key linemen to the NFL but still boast one of the nation\u2019s top linebackers in Taurean York and a strong front line. The biggest question mark remains in the secondary, which struggled last season and finished just 98th in team coverage grade (67.3).", "2025 Bottom line": "Texas A&M has the talent to push for a College Football Playoff berth \u2014 if Marcel Reed takes the next step as a passer and the defense finds a few new difference-makers.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-texas-am-aggies"}, {"Title": "Vanderbilt Commodores", "Team Logo": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/238.png", "Team color": "#FEEEB6", "2024 Recap": "Vanderbilt was one of college football\u2019s best Cinderella stories in 2024, posting its first winning season since James Franklin\u2019s final year in 2013.

For Vanderbilt to take the next step, however, the defense will need to show meaningful improvement.", "2025 Bottom line": "The duo of Diego Pavia and LJ Stowers might be enough to get Vanderbilt back to a bowl game, but any real progress will require more support from a defense that has struggled to hold up its end.", "Link": "https://www.pff.com/news/college-football-preview-2025-vanderbilt-commodores"}]}};
