Then, as he gets through the second level, the free safety comes down to tackle him at the 28-yard line, but the back forces a missed tackle and capitalizes on it with another 10 yards.', 3: "The RB escapes the unblocked linebacker on the edge to turn what could have been a 0-yard gain into a positive gain. He then cuts back to the middle of the field and uses his speed to beat the angle of the safety coming over, turning it into a sizeable gain. As he continues downfield, he's conscious of a defender in pursuit and uses a stiff arm to set up a teammate for a block. After that, he's able to maintain his balance and add another 15 yards.", 4: 'The RB runs through an arm-tackle attempt in the backfield before hitting the hole into the second level. Once there, he simultaneously evades a tackle attempt down by his ankles while powering through a linebacker who has a fistful of his jersey. After escaping that, he stiff-arms a cornerback and plants him into the ground around the 10-yard line. He does all of that while maintaining his balance and grinding out another 7-8 yards through contact from two additional defenders to finish the run right at the one-inch line.'};
