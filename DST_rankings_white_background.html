He‚Äôs consistently graded as a top-10 wide receiver, with his fantasy performance elevated by his environment. The Bengals made no changes to the coaching staff impacting Chase, the quarterback room, the wide receiver room or the tight end room. This puts Chase in one of the most pass-friendly environments in the NFL, catching passes from the best passer. While we should expect regression from anyone who finishes first in fantasy points, the lack of changes in Cincinnati should help minimize the regression. puts Chase in one of the most pass-friendly environments in the NFL, catching passes from the best passer.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Bijan Robinson was a rare top-10 NFL draft pick at running back, leading to hefty expectations. He began meeting those expectations over the second half of 2024, consistently playing over 70% of the Falcons' offensive snaps and running at least 17 times in all but one game. This led to 22.4 fantasy points per game over the last nine weeks. He didn‚Äôt see as many 15-plus-yard carries as other great running backs, even though he‚Äôs got the talent and speed to have those runs. It‚Äôs possible some positive regression could greatly help his fantasy production this season. He lost Drew Dalman at center and still has an elite backup in Tyler Allgeier, so there is also some room to lose fantasy value.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Gibbs was the 12th overall pick of the 2023 NFL Draft and is one of just three running backs selected with a top-20 pick in the last seven drafts. His playing time has been limited the past two seasons as he splits time with David Montgomery. He‚Äôs managed to be an elite fantasy option with the most fantasy points per carry over the last two seasons of any running back. When Montgomery was injured late last season, he showed he could be the best running back in fantasy football if given enough opportunity. The Lions have a new offensive coordinator and new running back coach, which could lead to an increase in chances for Gibbs, pushing him closer to the top of the fantasy draft board.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Jefferson has been the best wide receiver in the NFL since he was drafted in 2020, with a league-leading 93.6 receiving grade. He also ranks first in receiving yards per game at 96.5 and yards per route run at 2.64. He‚Äôs among the top five fantasy wide receivers in the last four seasons. No other wide receiver has accomplished that more than twice in those four years. In the previous three seasons, his fantasy points per game have been three points higher with Kirk Cousins compared to without him. That‚Äôs the difference between a top-five finish and a top-10 finish. Jefferson‚Äôs fantasy finish will depend heavily on J.J. McCarthy's development.</div></div>

In his final seven games, he gained at least 13 PPR points each week and averaged 21.5 points, third behind only Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and Puka Nacua. He played at least 84% of his team‚Äôs offensive snaps in all but one of those games. The team added Travis Hunter in the draft, and he will see a decent target rate, but typically, two great wide receivers can co-exist as long as there isn‚Äôt much more competition for targets. Thomas led all wide receivers in yards per route run out of the slot with 3.12, and new offensive coordinator Liam Coen has found a lot of success with his slot receivers in the past. An increased role in the slot could lead Thomas to remain among the top wide receivers in fantasy football.</div></div>

His 88.4 receiving grade also finished third among tight ends, behind Kittle and McBride. Bowers is expected to leap over the two tight ends with general improvements to the Raiders' offense, leading to more accurate passes thrown his way and more touchdowns.

His 92.7 grade over those three years is tied for second-best among wide receivers, only behind Tyreek Hill. This had helped him to back-to-back seasons as a top-10 fantasy receiver, but the Saquon Barkley addition has slowed his fantasy success. His routes per game dropped by six, and there were multiple games, including the playoffs, where the Eagles simply didn‚Äôt need to prioritize Brown. While he‚Äôs still capable of putting together several top-10 fantasy finishes, he‚Äôs also going to have a high rate of games outside the top-36 fantasy receivers, compared to other wide receivers of his talent.</div></div>

Achane may lose snaps in short-yardage and goal-line situations, as the Dolphins added much bigger backs to be backups.</div></div>

The threat of Lamar Jackson also being able to run out of the backfield was a matchup nightmare for defenses, allowing both Jackson and Henry to thrive. Over the last five years, he led all running backs per game in rushing yards (102.5), yards after contact (74.9), rushing touchdowns (0.92), avoided tackles (4.4) and fantasy points from rushing (15.6). However, Henry is very old for a running back, and Keaton Mitchell is now a year and a half removed from his complete ACL tear.

He averaged 20.7 PPR points per game over his last eight games, including the playoffs. However, offensive coordinator Greg Roman, a run-first coach, added two new running backs to lead the offense.

A lot in Cincinnati stayed the same, including the offensive coaching staff, quarterback, wide receiver and tight end depth chart. His high target share should remain, but some regression mixed with a slightly more run-heavy approach will likely lead to fewer routes and fewer touchdowns.

The Bills used to be among the most pass-heavy teams in the league, but under Joe Brady, they‚Äôve been more balanced. Combine that with the Bills' positive game scripts, which has led to a notable decrease in dropbacks per game. That has moved Allen from 24-25 fantasy points per game to 22-23.

His 22.6 fantasy points per start since 2020 ranks second-best for all quarterbacks, behind Josh Allen. For many reasons, his fantasy points per start hit a new low last season. A lot of his stats that were down last season should bounce back this season, except for passing dropbacks per game. While that might increase from last season, Saquon Barkley‚Äôs presence will ensure he remains below league average in dropbacks per game.</div></div>

His rate of receiving a +-0.5 rushing grade is among the lowest in the league, while his rate of a +1 or higher is among the best in the league. Usually, this is the recipe for a big decline in fantasy production. However, Taylor has a high rate of big plays, the trust of the coaching staff, and an excellent 2021 season, so there is always a chance he returns to that form. He also has an extensive injury history, including an ankle injury in the middle of four of his last five seasons. Taylor is a fine top-15 fantasy option, with a decent chance to finish in the top 10, and an outside chance to return to the league‚Äôs elite.</div></div>

His rise corresponded with the Bengals' playoff push, where the offense was scoring at least 24 points per game. Brown followed Joe Mixon as the clear early down running back who rarely played on passing downs. He was in a pass-first offense but was able to score and receive plenty of opportunities because the offense was doing well. There should be a little regression in the offense this season, but the bigger concern is if Moss or sixth-round rookie Tahj Brooks can simply outplay Brooks, leading to a change in the starting lineup.</div></div>

However, the presence of Najee Harris and the lack of receiving potential will likely prevent Hampton from being an immediate top-10 fantasy running back. He will likely be a fantasy starter early on in his rookie season. The more the Chargers change their offense to fit Hampton in terms of more zone runs and more running back targets, the better his fantasy value will be.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>James Cook has been a worthy starter for the Bills' offense, benefiting from a strong supporting cast in Buffalo, but is limited due to the Bills' committee approach at running back. He only scored two rushing touchdowns in 2023, which hurt his fantasy production, and then scored 16 in 2024. This season will very likely be somewhere in between, making him a fine RB2 option, or even RB1 for someone waiting for a running back. The only concern is that Cook is in a contract year and wants a new contract after so many of his teammates secured long-term deals this offseason. While that could lead Cook to play even better than what we‚Äôve seen, we could also see a holdout, or the Bills wanting a better look from Ray Davis before next offseason.</div></div>

His efficiency has dropped in the last four years, but he‚Äôs remained a consistent fantasy option thanks to his volume in both the run and pass games. That volume was even higher last season due to injuries to Derek Carr, Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed. This year, he has a little more competition for touches from a healthy Kendre Miller and rookie Devin Neal. The most concerning thing is that new head coach Kellen Moore has a history of not prioritizing running backs in the game, even when he‚Äôs had Saquon Barkley, Austin Ekeler and Ezekiel Elliott during his peak. This should lead Kamara to fall outside the top-10 fantasy running backs, but his job as the lead rusher is generally safer than most other running backs in the league.</div></div>

He received the 19th-most targets, and the top of the Cardinals' running back, wide receiver and tight end depth chart are identical to last season. He should finish among the top-20 wide receivers in targets again, and he needs to improve his chemistry with Kyler Murray so his fantasy value can also be among the top-20 wide receivers.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>The sky is the limit for Hunter, a truly unique athlete. He is arguably the best wide receiver and best cornerback in the 2025 draft class. That uniqueness makes it difficult to project how much he can help a fantasy manager at the wide receiver position. Fantasy-relevant wide receivers are consistently playing a minimum of 75% of offensive snaps, and there is a chance Hunter falls below that threshold. His role on offense could be restricted in a way that makes Hunter unstartable, but Hunter could also become the top wide receiver in the NFL and fantasy. He is arguably the most risky player to pick in fantasy drafts, offering both significant risk and reward.</div></div>

A top-ten season is within the realm of possibility if he dominates the passing down role and also averages at least eight carries per game.

He‚Äôs consistently ranked among the low-end RB1 or high-end RB2 in recent seasons when looking at points per game, but he‚Äôs often missed a few games each season, making his overall rank a little lower. The Trey Benson addition in the 2024 draft makes it difficult to fully trust Conner, but he‚Äôs also put together his best two seasons of his career in terms of his quality of play. Over the last two seasons, he ranks second among running backs in rushing avoided tackles per game (4.5), rushing avoided tackles per attempt (0.297) and yards after contact per attempt (3.6). We should expect another season where he averages 15-16 PPR points per game, unless his quality of play starts to decline, in which case Benson might see a larger role.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>DeVonta Smith has been a consistent top-24 fantasy wide receiver throughout his career. He played more often in the slot last season, earning 2.23 yards per route run over the last three seasons. This led to a higher target rate, a career-high yards per route run and receiving grade and fantasy points per game, despite the team running the ball much more frequently. The team lost offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who helped elevate Smith‚Äôs play by putting him in situations to succeed. Injuries to A.J. Brown and Dallas Goedert helped his fantasy value, and they will ideally be healthier this season. However, the team‚Äôs pass rate should also increase to help counteract this, potentially passing more near the goal line, which could lead to more Smith touchdowns. A top-20 finish seems likely, although that could move up depending on how much more they are running and how he‚Äôs used without Moore.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Worthy was a first-round pick with high expectations, joining Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid. Most of his rookie season was inconsistent, posting a few big plays here and there, but he never earned enough volume to start in fantasy football. Over the last few weeks of the season and into the playoffs, the Chiefs altered his role to resemble Rashee Rice‚Äôs before his injury. This led Worthy to play like a top-10 fantasy wide receiver over a seven-game stretch, including two excellent receiving grades in the conference championship and the Super Bowl. Rice and Hollywood Brown are healthy now. While all three will get opportunities out of the slot, it‚Äôs possible Worthy can be a top-10 fantasy wide receiver if he gets to keep doing what he did at the end of last season. He may not be worth starting if Rice returns completely to that role and Worthy is stuck being an inconsistent deep threat.</div></div>

Hall has the talent to be a top-five fantasy running back again, but a lot is working against him with the new Jets offense. Hall plays notably better on gap-scheme runs, while his teammates play better on zone runs. His latest offensive coordinator comes from an offense that was among the most zone-heavy last season. His new offensive coordinator is used to a two-man committee, which could make Hall more of a receiving back and less of a rusher.

That will no longer be the case with the addition of Nick Chubb. The fact that Mixon ranks second in career rushing attempts for active players could lead to the Texans resting him more. The increase in passing options could lead to fewer rushing attempts as well. This will likely make him fall outside of the top 10 fantasy running backs.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>D.K. Metcalf was consistently a focal point of the Seattle Seahawks' offense, making him a consistent fantasy starter for several years. His 2024 season was shaping up to be his best season yet, but he suffered an MCL pull midseason, which led to two missed games and decreased production over the rest of the year. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he will be the clear top target with less competition for targets than he ever had with the Seahawks. However, he has Arthur Smith as his new offensive coordinator, and top wide receivers have consistently produced more receiving yards in the seasons before or after they had Smith compared to when they did not have Smith. Metcalf gains Aaron Rodgers as a quarterback, but Rodgers hasn‚Äôt been as good at deeper targets recently as Geno Smith, so the quarterback change is a downgrade for Metcalf.</div></div>

He remains the top option in the Denver Broncos offense, accumulating a particularly high target rate in the red zone. That will probably continue, but the opportunity is there for Sutton to have his best season yet if Bo Nix continues his progression at quarterback. However, Denver also has multiple up-and-coming young wide receivers who could cut into Sutton‚Äôs target rate and potentially make him tradeable at the NFL‚Äôs trade deadline.</div></div>

However, Samuel has dealt with several injuries throughout his career. In 2024 alone, he was listed with six different injuries on the official NFL injury reports. He was traded to the Washington Commanders this offseason, pairing him with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. When Kingsbury was with the Arizona Cardinals, he found unique ways to use Rondale Moore and Greg Dortch on short passes and passes out of the backfield. They should be able to use Samuel in the same way, but with more success.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Chris Godwin has a high ceiling as a top-10 fantasy performer but faces several challenges in the 2025 season. After a strong 2019 season, his production has fluctuated due to injuries and changes to the Buccaneers' offense. Last season, a dislocated ankle ended his promising start, as he was averaging the second-most fantasy points per game. Despite re-signing with the Buccaneers, his health remains a concern. His role could be impacted by Jalen McMillan and 19th-overall pick Emeka Egbuka, who also specialize in slot positions, potentially reducing Godwin's playing time as he recovers. The Buccaneers also lost Liam Coen, which could further impact the offense to help other players without helping Godwin. This all makes Godwin a very big, high-risk, high-reward option this season.</div></div>

He‚Äôs been able to propel himself to a low-end WR2 these last two seasons, despite his situation not always being perfect. The Raiders made several changes to their offense this offseason. The biggest positive for Meyers is the Geno Smith addition, giving Meyers a better quarterback than he‚Äôs seen throughout his time as a starter in the NFL. This should lead to a higher touchdown total than last season. However, the team added Ashton Jeanty, which almost certainly will lead the Raiders to run more than last season, leading to Meyers running fewer routes. The Raiders also spent several draft picks on wide receivers who will contribute this season. If they have normal rookie seasons, Meyers is fine, but if someone exceeds expectations, then Meyers could fall down the target pecking order.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>David Montgomery has spent the last two years sharing the Detroit Lions' backfield with Jahmyr Gibbs. The Lions have been a high-scoring offense behind an elite offensive line, allowing the two to co-exist. Montgomery has received most of the goal-line work, leading him to score a touchdown in all but seven games over the last two seasons. This has helped Montgomery finish as a top-24 running back in 82% of his games. However, the Lions lost Ben Johnson and replaced him with John Morton. The team will probably move away from Johnson‚Äôs unique rotation, which could leave Montgomery performing more like a usual backup. He still deserves a decent draft pick because, at a minimum, he will be an elite handcuff.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Jennings spent his first three seasons as a slot-only wide receiver on an offense that doesn‚Äôt use three-receiver sets as often as most teams. He seemed destined for the third spot on the depth chart after the team added Ricky Pearsall in the first round of the 2024 draft. Instead, he had the opportunity to take over for Deebo Samuel for one game in Week 3, and he caught 11 passes for 175 yards and three touchdowns. He took over for Brandon Aiyuk for the second half of last season and averaged 14.1 PPR points per game during that time. The 49ers moved on from Samuel, which should give Jennings a permanent spot in the 49ers' starting offense. His fantasy value has a wide range of outcomes, depending on Aiyuk‚Äôs health, Pearsall‚Äôs ability to improve, and whether Jennings can continue building off what he accomplished last season.</div></div>

An injury to Christian McCaffrey allowed Mason to be a starter to begin the 2024 season, and he was sixth in fantasy points per game over five weeks before he started dealing with injuries. Mason was traded to the Minnesota Vikings, where Aaron Jones Sr. is the main running back. The two will likely be in a committee that includes Mason receiving significant work in rushing situations while Jones gets more in passing situations. Jones is over 30 years old and has dealt with multiple injuries over the last two seasons. While Mason might not score enough weekly to start in fantasy in normal situations, if Jones is dealing with an injury or is showing more signs of age, we could see Jones as a weekly player to start.</div></div>

He caught 19 of 29 passes for 411 yards for 3.37 yards per route run. The Green Bay Packers allow him an opportunity to become an actual number one receiver, a chance he wasn‚Äôt going to see with most teams.

The Kansas City Chiefs retained Kareem Hunt and brought in Elijah Mitchell, which gives Pacheco some competition on early downs, but they also didn‚Äôt re-sign Samaje Perine, opening the door for someone to step up in passing situations. The general appeal of a Chiefs running back is that they are typically a high-scoring offense, so even though they pass the ball a lot, their running back should score a lot of touchdowns. The offense hasn‚Äôt scored as many points in the last two seasons, but that could change this year with a healthy wide receiver room. There‚Äôs a chance he gets back to his 2023 form, scoring potentially more touchdowns, but there is also a chance he is in an ugly three-man backfield that changes from one week to the next, making it impossible to know if or when you can start him. There are plenty of scenarios in between, making him a fine gamble outside of the top-24 running backs.</div></div>

The Chicago Bears gave him more competition for targets with tight end Colston Loveland in the first round and wide receiver Luther Burden III in the second. In most cases, a new regime bringing in two new receivers would be devastating to an incumbent receiver who wasn‚Äôt fantasy-relevant. However, the Bears' new head coach is Ben Johnson, who led an offense where nearly all of the skill players who played significant snaps were fantasy starters.

This led to seven mostly underwhelming weeks in 2024 before Aiyuk‚Äôs season abruptly ended with an ACL and MCL tear. The injury could leave Aiyuk missing time to start the 2025 season, and it often takes time before a wide receiver is back to his usual quality of play.

The Patriots spent the 38th overall pick on TreVeyon Henderson, who was arguably the best receiving back in this draft class. That means Stevenson will likely lose most of his passing-down work.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Brock Purdy went from the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft to the San Francisco 49ers' starter. In 2023, he was a top-10 fantasy quarterback, but Kyle Shanahan's scheme and all of the 49ers' skill players got a lot of the credit. In 2024, the 49ers were losing, Purdy dealt with injuries, and all of the 49ers' best offensive players missed significant time. Purdy‚Äôs fantasy points per game only dropped by 0.4. Purdy ran more often to help make up for the decreased passing value, which ultimately made him more consistent from a fantasy perspective. Purdy doesn‚Äôt have the elite rushing or passing value to make him a top-five fantasy quarterback, but he‚Äôs a relatively safe bet to finish as a top-10 quarterback again.</div></div>

This resulted in Kraft not averaging enough points to be a consistent fantasy starter, but he also wasn‚Äôt too far behind the top 12.

Even when Diggs is ready to play again, he might not be the same player. He will turn 32 years old before the end of the season, an age at which wide receivers tend to decline, even ignoring the injury. Diggs should be able to gain some chemistry with Drake Maye, who has been very accurate on shorter passes, which pairs well with Diggs' low average depth of target in recent seasons.

It only took Tracy a little over a month to crack the Giants' starting lineup, and for the middle part of the season, he was a top-10 fantasy running back. He slowed down over the final third of the season to the disappointment of fantasy managers who picked him up off waivers. The Giants selected Cameron Skattebo in the fourth round of the NFL draft this year, which will give Tracy some serious competition for playing time. Tracy won‚Äôt have any fantasy value if he loses the starting job, and a 50/50 split could lead to both running backs being unstartable. If Tracy can maintain his playing time, there is a chance he could have more value this season thanks to Russell Wilson being the likely starter at quarterback, and his recent history of checking down to his running back.</div></div>

He had seven games with 80 or more receiving yards, and his career-high five touchdowns occurred during those seven games. However, he was held to three receptions for less than 40 yards in six of his games. Michael Penix Jr. has taken over as the Falcons' starting quarterback, and his quality of play will determine Mooney‚Äôs fantasy value. In a small sample, Penix has thrown deep at a high rate with high deep accuracy, which could lead to a huge season by Mooney, but if Penix regresses, then Mooney will be a fantasy backup.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Bo Nix found a lot of success from a fantasy perspective as a rookie, finishing eighth in fantasy points per game. Typically, when rookie quarterbacks find success in fantasy football, it‚Äôs from being a dominant runner, but for Nix, it was a mix of a high passing touchdown rate and solid rushing. While Nix‚Äôs touchdown rate will likely regress, he should generally improve as a passer in his second season. The Broncos added receiving running back R.J. Harvey in the second round of the draft in addition to veteran tight end Evan Engram, and both should be improvements over last season. The Broncos had the best pass-blocking offensive line last season, and it stayed relatively healthy. If Nix regresses this season, the most likely reason would be injuries to the line.</div></div>

However, the team's first-round draft pick, Omarion Hampton, significantly diminishes Harris‚Äô potential role. Hampton is projected to be the lead back, leaving Harris likely as a backup who should still receive some carries each week.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Caleb Williams, drafted first overall by the Bears, had a rough start to his rookie season but showed flashes of great quarterback play, ending up 22nd in fantasy points per game among quarterbacks. Williams showed flashes in a few starts, which led to both high PFF grades and top-six fantasy finishes. There are a lot of reasons for optimism with the addition of head coach Ben Johnson, first-round pick tight end Colston Loveland, second-round pick wide receiver Luther Burden III and guard Joe Thuney. However, Johnson‚Äôs offenses have been more run-heavy, so Williams will likely drop back to pass less often. He also took a lot of sacks, and the Bears' offensive line makeover helped their run blocking while hurting their pass protection. Williams‚Äô fantasy production may get worse before it gets better. Williams is an excellent option for those in single-quarterback leagues who want to wait on quarterbacks. Anyone drafting Williams will need another option, just in case all of the new moving parts on offense need some time to work out. Williams has one of the clearest paths to be a top-five fantasy quarterback among those ranked outside of the top 10.</div></div>

He signed a two-year contract with the Denver Broncos, who have thrown the fewest passes to tight ends over the past two seasons. That should change in 2025, but head coach Sean Payton has a long history of rotating his skill players. He brought in Jeremy Shockey and Jared Cook near the end of their careers, and both averaged 21 to 24 routes per game. While Engram should help the Broncos and provide a missing element to their offense, he will have trouble reaching the volume he's used to.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Marvin Mims Jr. enters the 2025 season as a late-round fantasy football dart throw with intriguing potential. After a quiet start to his career with the Denver Broncos, Mims showed flashes late last season, particularly during a seven-game stretch where he was 23rd in PPR points per game with 15.5. He posted an elite 89.7 receiving grade during those seven games, finishing with a target on 30.4% of his routes, which led to 4.25 yards per route run. After being a deep threat earlier in his career, his average depth of target fell to 4.2 yards. His role expanded significantly in the playoffs, highlighted by a 69% snap rate. While the Broncos' wide receiver room has become more crowded, no one has the same size and speed as Mims in their offense. Mims' fantasy value hinges on his early-season snap rate ‚Äì if he sees the field, he could be a solid fantasy starter, but otherwise, he‚Äôs a player you can drop early.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Braelon Allen, the Jets' fourth-round pick from the 2024 NFL Draft, aims to emulate David Montgomery's role in the 2025 season under new head coach Aaron Glenn and offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand. Allen's strength lies in short-yardage situations, converting 14 of 16 attempts when the Jets needed two yards or less for a first down, earning him a league-best 90.0 rushing grade on those plays. Montgomery was a consistent fantasy starter under these coaches thanks to a role that wore down defenses and his ability to score touchdowns. Allen needs to be used in the same way, the Jets need to score often enough for Allen to score a lot of touchdowns, and Justin Fields can‚Äôt be used for tush pushes in order for this to happen.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Roschon Johnson enters the 2025 season with the potential for a significantly expanded role in the Chicago Bears' offense, particularly if the team doesn't add another running back this offseason. While he's primarily been utilized as a passing-down and short-yardage back in his NFL career, Johnson profiles as a strong fit in the new Ben Johnson-led scheme, which favors zone runs (where he averages 4.0 yards per carry). His proven ability near the goal line (eight career rushing touchdowns from the 1- or 2-yard line) suggests a more prominent role could be on the horizon. As a late-round fantasy option, he is a high-upside player but also one who can be quickly dropped if his role remains limited.</div></div>

Love‚Äôs yards per attempt improved in 2024, but his fantasy value took a step back. Love dealt with multiple injuries over the season, and the Packers added Josh Jacobs at running back. This led the team to become more run-heavy, while Love ran the ball less often himself. With five fewer passing attempts per game, Love‚Äôs passing volume decreased, moving Love into the QB2 range. While Love should be healthier this season, Jacobs‚Äô presence will still leave them throwing less often than in 2023. Love should be a fantasy starter if the matchup is right, but he will need to improve as a passer to return to being a must-start fantasy option.</div></div>

However, his second season saw a dip, especially during a seven-game stretch where he averaged only 12.7 points per game, coinciding with Nico Collins' injury. His deep ball success regressed to the mean. While his accuracy improved, the Texans need to convert more field goals into touchdowns to elevate Stroud to elite status.

Goedert has been a low-end TE1 in fantasy points per game throughout his career, which should continue to be the case.

Bijan Robinson‚Äôs arrival in 2023 has prevented Allgeier from being a fantasy starter the last two seasons. Allgeier remains a critical backup and a top-tier handcuff option, particularly within the Falcons' zone-heavy run scheme, where he averages 4.6 yards per carry, positioning him as a must-start fantasy asset if Robinson is sidelined. This is further boosted by an elite run-blocking line. However, he only has standalone value in very deep leagues.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Keaton Mitchell, an undrafted rookie in 2023, showed flashes of brilliance despite battling injuries, averaging an impressive 8.4 yards per carry as a rookie. He notably had a breakout game in Week 9 against the Seahawks, rushing for 138 yards and a touchdown. While an ACL tear hampered his 2024, he still ranked fourth best among all running backs with 0.64 carries of 20 or more yards per game over the last two seasons. Looking ahead to 2025, Mitchell is likely to be the third option behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill, but his big-play potential makes him an intriguing handcuff in fantasy leagues if Henry were to miss time, as Mitchell would likely lead the team in carries while Hill remains the receiving back.</div></div>

Expectations were high for 2024, but he dealt with multiple injuries, and then Dak Prescott missed the second half of the season. There was a stretch of games from Weeks 3 to 9 when Ferguson was a top-12 fantasy tight end, which was the only stretch both Ferguson and Prescott were healthy. While both players should ideally be in a good position to start the 2025 season, the Cowboys traded for George Pickens. This will push Ferguson from second to third in terms of target pecking order in the offense. Prescott didn‚Äôt play as well in 2024 when he was healthy compared to 2023.

He spent nearly all of his starts throwing between 210 and 290 yards with a touchdown pass and scrambling at a high rate. This left him between QB12 and QB18 for nearly all of his starts. The Patriots made several changes to their offense this season, adding free agent wide receiver Stefon Diggs and tackle Morgan Moses in addition to drafting tackle Will Campbell, running back TreVeyon Henderson and wide receiver Kyle Williams, among other moves. While this should help Maye improve, it‚Äôs challenging to rely on rookies working out immediately, or players in their 30s remaining the same players they were throughout their careers. Maye is a very safe second option in superflex leagues, but a lot of the changes will need to go well for Maye to become a typical starter in single quarterback leagues.</div></div>

He could have chosen to have surgery, but he wanted to play through the pain, even though this hurt his fantasy value. Pittman should be back to normal in terms of health this season, but he has increased competition for targets with Josh Downs in the slot and rookie tight end Tyler Warren. Pittman‚Äôs fantasy numbers have notably been better without Anthony Richardson Sr., so the winner of the Colts‚Äô quarterback battle could influence his potential.

He is projected to be the top slot receiver. The Texans spend their second- and third-round picks on wide receivers, but Kirk should begin the season with the job, and if he keeps playing well, he should keep it. Kirk benefits from playing with quarterback C.J. Stroud, who has a history of targeting slot receivers, as evidenced by Stefon Diggs ranking 18th in fantasy points per game with 15.2 last season. Nick Caley is the team‚Äôs new offensive coordinator, and the offenses that he‚Äôs been a part of have a track record of heavily featuring the slot receiver in the passing game, as shown by the Los Angeles Rams earning the second-most targets to wide receivers in the slot from 2023-2024.

It is very rare for a team to utilize two wide receivers who are typically X receivers on a high percentage of plays.

He was used as a field-stretching X receiver with a high average depth of target and high deep target rate. These kinds of players typically aren‚Äôt great for fantasy, although Coleman‚Äôs target rate was higher than most of these kinds of receivers.

It‚Äôs hard to trust these kinds of receivers for fantasy purposes. Shaheed seemed like he could be an exception last season, but now, he has a less-than-ideal quarterback situation. New head coach Kellen Moore has never had a wide receiver like Shaheed, and most of his successful fantasy wide receivers have played predominantly out of the slot.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Hollywood Brown is a fun late-round dart throw with the Kansas City Chiefs. On one hand, he‚Äôs never been a top-24 fantasy option and will likely be behind Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy on the depth chart. However, Brown is also a speedy deep threat who hasn‚Äôt had the best luck with quarterbacks with good deep ball accuracy. Mahomes' connection with Tyreek Hill was incredibly valuable for fantasy and real-life purposes, and Brown is the closest thing Mahomes has had to Hill. If the two can have anywhere close to the same connection, that could lead to a very high ceiling. If things aren‚Äôt working out early in the year, then it would be fine to drop Brown from your fantasy roster.</div></div>

Despite rarely finishing as a top-24 receiver in any given week, he ranked sixth among all receivers over the past two seasons with a 0.235 avoided tackles per reception while also showcasing a high single coverage open rate. This indicates that, given increased opportunity, he could be a very effective player. The Josh McDaniels - who has a track record of featuring slot receivers like Douglas, including Wes Welker and Julian Edelman - addition as offensive coordinator suggests a potential for a significant increase in targets, making Douglas one of the best late-round wide receiver options for fantasy football.</div></div>

White‚Äôs quality of play improved in 2024, but the Buccaneers added Bucky Irving, who was a better runner and receiver.

Doubs has become a regular starter over the last two seasons, playing at least 80% of his team‚Äôs offensive snaps in most games. He scored eight touchdowns in 2023 and showed a high floor in 2024, finishing with over 30 yards in nine of 13 games. While he's consistently been a waiver-wire option in fantasy leagues, he has finished 47th and 50th in fantasy points per game in the last two seasons. The Packers' rookie additions at wide receiver, including Matthew Golden and Savion Williams, could complicate his role. There is a chance Doubs could be the odd man out of the wide receiver room given his salary and lack of special-teams contribution. However, if he can solidify his starting role and build on his consistent improvement, especially with Jordan Love improving his accuracy, Doubs could become a more reliable fantasy starter and lead the team in targets.

Despite this, he's reportedly healthy and ready for training camp in 2025. Lloyd joins a Packers running back room led by Josh Jacobs, who earned a 91.6 offensive grade last season (90.6 in the run game), which makes it unlikely Lloyd can win the starting job. Lloyd will need to compete with Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks for backup snaps, and while the Packers' offense, which saw Zach Tom jump to an 87.8 run-blocking grade in 2024, offers opportunities, it tends to favor a committee approach and could lean more toward the passing game in the upcoming season. Ultimately, Lloyd remains a late-round fantasy football option who is a handcuff for Jacobs, requiring patience from fantasy managers who hope for an opportunity should Jacobs miss time.</div></div>

He began both 2023 and 2024 as a backup, but early-season trades of starting wide receivers opened the door for Tillman to start. While his production was limited for his first season and a half, he posted an excellent four-game stretch with Jameis Winston as quarterback, where he led the team in targets, averaging eighth in the league in fantasy points per game during that period. He not only had Winston throwing to him, but he finally got to play X receiver after the team traded Amari Cooper. His best performance comes against man coverage, and he‚Äôs earned a 68.6 receiving grade when lined up out wide and on the line of scrimmage. Despite flashes of potential and a knack for avoiding tackles, Tillman's future remains uncertain, largely dependent on the Browns' evolving quarterback situation and how he fits within a revamped receiving corps that includes Diontae Johnson and Jerry Jeudy, making him a late-round gamble.</div></div>

Last season, Ekeler‚Äôs efficiency suffered due to the Commanders' poor run blocking, as he averaged 7.6 yards per carry on perfectly blocked runs over the last three seasons but only 2.6 yards per carry on non-perfectly blocked runs.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Williams is an undersized receiver at 5-foot-1‚Äù and 190 pounds. He‚Äôs in the bottom 20th percentile in both arm length and hand size. He played primarily on the outside throughout his college career. Typically, receivers of his size are great against zone defense and struggle against man, but that was the opposite for Williams. He wasn‚Äôt given many opportunities out of the slot, but he thrived when given the opportunity. He joins a crowded wide receiver room with five wide receivers who averaged at least 22 routes per game over the last three seasons, and two recent high draft picks. It might take some time for Williams to work his way up the depth chart, but there is a chance Williams starts as a rookie.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Blake Corum enters the 2025 fantasy football season in a precarious position, much like last year. His value hinges entirely on becoming the Los Angeles Rams' starting running back, a role currently held by Kyren Williams. Last season, Corum averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and primarily played only one drive per game until Week 18, when a forearm fracture prematurely ended his only start. Rams head coach Sean McVay has a uniquely clear history of utilizing one clear runner over his backups. Rookie Jarquez Hunter's presence makes it a little less likely that Corum will become the starter if he falls below Hunter on the depth chart. However, Williams hasn‚Äôt necessarily played well enough to remain the starter, and his contract year and situation could complicate matters for Williams. Corum remains a high-end handcuff who needs to overtake Williams to have any fantasy value.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Rashod Bateman has shown flashes of potential as a deep threat for the Baltimore Ravens. He notably caught eight of 15 deep passes for 292 yards and five touchdowns last season, finishing with a 36.7-yard average depth of target on those deep targets, the most for a wide receiver with 15 or more deep targets. However, he's struggled to consistently produce for fantasy football, never truly establishing himself as a reliable starter in redraft leagues due to low route totals in the Ravens' run-first offense and a low target rate with significant competition for targets. While his high single coverage open rates and decent yards per route run suggest untapped potential, his role in the offense, the DeAndre Hopkins addition, will make it even harder for Bateman to receive more volume, even if he can improve on a per-target basis. This makes Bateman a high-risk, high-reward option best suited for best ball or DFS formats rather than traditional redraft leagues.</div></div>

His standout performance came in Week 4 against the Cincinnati Bengals, where he caught six passes for 66 yards and a touchdown. However, he only exceeded 10 PPR points from receptions and yards alone in that one game. While his playing time increased significantly midseason, his fantasy value didn't follow suit, and he struggled to get open consistently. There has been some general positive buzz about Legette this offseason. The Panthers moved him from Z to X midseason, which likely didn‚Äôt help. He will be moving back to Z this season with the Tetairoa McMillan addition. Ultimately, if he makes these strides in Dave Canales' offense with Bryce Young, he could become a valuable fantasy asset.</div></div>

In 2024, he landed at the top of the depth chart and his 86.0 receiving grade was the best for an Illinois wide receiver in a season in PFF‚Äôs history. He played well on the outside against man coverage and struggles at separation, which makes him an X receiver candidate. However, the Broncos under Sean Payton have preferred taller receivers, which means Bryant may play anywhere in the formation. Typically, only one wide receiver in Bryant‚Äôs offense has been fantasy-relevant at a time because of his frequent rotation of players.

Despite a significant increase in receptions and targets, his catch rate declined due to a high rate of contested passes and seven dropped passes. He‚Äôs maintained a high rate of avoided tackles at 0.033 per route, the seventh-most among wide receivers during his career, and a high rate of gaining separation on plays where he‚Äôs expected to gain separation. The Giants are changing quarterbacks, and Russell Wilson will likely to win the job. Recently, Wilson has both a high tendency to throw deep and a high tendency to check down to his running backs, which will likely lead to a decrease in targets for Robinson. However, the quality of passes should improve due to Wilson‚Äôs high short-yardage accuracy. This could put Robinson in the WR3 conversation, even though the odds of him being a top-24 fantasy wide receiver are very low.</div></div>

His cleanest path to playing time with the Cleveland Browns could be as a receiver. He had the highest receiving grade of the Browns running backs and highest yards per route run, albeit both were in college compared to numbers in the pros. The biggest concern for all of the Browns' running backs is the offensive line.</div></div>

He scored eight touchdowns and had two huge games. His target rate increased, and his yards per route run more than doubled, but that ultimately left him in the WR4 range. The Chargers added three new receivers, two new running backs and two new tight ends. This should allow Greg Roman to run an offense more similar to his past teams, where the wide receivers, other than the top one on the depth chart, didn‚Äôt have much fantasy production. Johnston‚Äôs 711 receiving yards last season were the most for a second wide receiver in a Roman offense.

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Brenton Strange enters the 2025 season as the clear lead tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars after showing flashes in 2024 when filling in for Evan Engram. He averaged 8.3 fantasy points per game as a starter, ranking 19th among tight ends. While he didn't establish himself as a consistent fantasy starter and faces more competition for targets after the addition of Travis Hunter, he did have a very high single coverage open target rate of 50.6%, highlighting his potential. There was minimal movement at tight end this off-season, leaving very few high-upside sleeper options. Strange is one of the few veterans who could make a significant step forward this season if he simply plays well enough.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Jalen McMillan, the 92nd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, initially struggled to find his footing but finished the 2024 NFL season strong, scoring the eighth-most fantasy points among wide receivers over his last five games. He demonstrated a knack for finding the end zone, with his 0.216 touchdowns per reception ranking third among wide receivers. Despite his late-season surge, McMillan faces a crowded Buccaneers wide receiver room in 2025, headlined by rookie Emeka Egbuka, a healthy Chris Godwin and veteran Mike Evans, making his projected role uncertain. He was primarily a slot receiver in college and averaged 1.85 yards per route run in the slot compared to 0.96 when lined up out wide. Despite this, McMillan will likely play on the outside again, with both Godwin and Egbuka also playing better in the slot. Tampa Bay's offensive coaching staff changes, with Josh Grizzard taking over as offensive coordinator and the potential for increased wide receiver rotation, further complicate McMillan‚Äôs fantasy outlook. While there's potential for McMillan to become fantasy-relevant through injuries to other receivers, his current situation suggests fantasy managers should use no more than a late-round flier pick on him, perhaps as a handcuff option.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Alec Pierce is a risky fantasy option for 2025, as he is largely dependent on Anthony Richardson remaining the Colts' quarterback. Pierce's usage as a deep threat, exemplified by his league-leading 22.8-yard average depth of target and 45.5% deep-target rate in 2024, makes him boom-or-bust. He had three games of 120-plus receiving yards and a touchdown and several games with minimal production last season. His 30.7 yards per win in 2024 and 67.7 yards per loss further highlight his reliance on comeback situations. While his upside is high with Richardson at the helm, Daniel Jones taking over quarterback duties would likely render Pierce irrelevant in fantasy.</div></div>

Despite flashes of brilliance, including averaging 79 rushing yards per start over the last five years, eighth-best among all running backs, Mitchell‚Äôs career has been plagued by injuries. After missing the entire 2024 season due to a hamstring injury, he joins a crowded Chiefs backfield where his role will hinge on his recovery and performance against competition like Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt. Mitchell's high-risk, high-reward situation could see him become the Chiefs‚Äô starting running back, fail to make the roster altogether, or anything in between. Luckily, we should have a good sense after Week 1 if Mitchell should remain on fantasy rosters or not.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>Kendre Miller presents a high-risk, high-reward late-round option at running back.. While he boasts impressive per-play numbers, including ranking in the top six in both avoided tackles per run and yards per route run over the last two seasons, his extensive injury history and the Devin Neal addition cast uncertainty over his role. There is at least a chance he can outplay Alvin Kamara in the run game, potentially allowing him to lead the team in carries. The two have identical yards per carry, while Miller has earned more yards after contact per attempt and twice as many avoided tackles per run. Miller has a slightly higher first-down rate. There is a seven-year age gap between Kamara and Miller, so Miller is more likely to improve while Kamara is more likely to decline. However, there is also a chance Neal or Clyde Edwards-Helaire can overtake Miller for the backup job.</div></div>

<div class="expand-section"><div class="expand-label">📊 Player Analysis</div><div>DeAndre Hopkins, a future Hall of Fame wide receiver, has seen his fantasy value decline despite his past dominance. After being a top-five fantasy receiver in five of six seasons from 2015 to 2020, his recent years have been marked by injuries and decreased playing time, culminating in just 9.2 fantasy points per game in 2024, 60th-best among wide receivers. Now with the Baltimore Ravens on a one-year deal, his role is uncertain in a crowded offense with players like Rashod Bateman, Zay Flowers, Mark Andrews, Isaiah Likely and Derrick Henry. While his 0.44 fantasy points per route over the past five seasons remains 11th-best among wide receivers, he faces competition for targets and playing time, making him a risky fantasy option, outside of DFS and best ball, though a WR3 season is possible if he takes the starting role from Bateman.</div></div>
